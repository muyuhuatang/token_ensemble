        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat.",

But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\"",

She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station.

The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours",

It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene.

At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity.

The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme.

SPFL rules forbid players from playing for their parent clubs if they return from lower-league loans after 31 March. United chairman Stephen Thompson has resigned from his position on the SPFL board in protest at the sanction. Having returned from loan spells from East Fife and Brechin respectively, Coote and Robson were not eligible to appear for United again until the start of next season. Dundee United pleaded guilty to breaches of SPFL Player Regulations 12, 14(i) and 14(ii), having failed to apply to register players as required by SPFL Player Regulations 7 and 3A. But chairman Thompson has stepped down from his SPFL board role with immediate effect. \"Whilst acknowledging the club's error and accepting a breach of rules occurred, the chairman feels the gravity of the punishment is wholly disproportionate",
        "The jury found Irek Hamidullin guilty on 15 counts, including supporting terrorists and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. The 55-year-old is the first military prisoner from Afghanistan to be tried in a US federal court. Some of the charges carry a mandatory life sentence. About 30 insurgents died in the attack, with Hamidullin the only survivor, while no American or Afghan soldiers were killed. Hamidullin, who did not testify during the trial, is expected to be sentenced on 6 November. Lawyers say it is unusual for someone captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan to be transferred to the United States for trial in a federal court.

        "Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say. Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: \"Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this. \"It is important that we understand how social media use relates to these.

The girls were take to the house of an assembly member in Chibok to be reunited with their parents but weren't allowed to go to their own homes. \"I can't believe my daughter has come this close to home but can't come home,\" said one father. \"There's no point bringing them to Chibok only to be locked in another prison.

Beijing has been building artificial islands on reefs in waters also claimed by other nations. Images published late last year show military defences on some islands, a think-tank says. Mr Tillerson, appearing before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, likened China's island-building to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \"We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops and second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.\" China's island-building has caused dismay in the region. Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, but Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims. In July an international tribunal ruled against Chinese claims, backing a case brought by the Philippines, but Beijing said it would not respect the verdict. The Obama administration has spoken out strongly against the island-building and has sought to build ties with, and among, the South East Asian",

The reason that the number one trending topic is also a vehicle problem is because those who tweeted about it were looking for fuel prices that were much higher than most people are willing to pay ( or are able to pay for ) .

Dominic Scott , head of the UK Council for International Student Affairs , said it would be a `` travesty of justice '' to let the UK Government run international education institutions . The UK Government also appears to be planning to expand universities of first choice in the UK beyond UK Qualifications Office - sponsored entry , to the extent that no further applications would be considered for a place after a year . For example , a student with top A levels , a very high number of GCSEs and a decent portfolio of other qualifications may not be selected - a system which would have been unfair even before the review of student numbers . The Chancellor seems to think that the UK should join the French and German Universities in offering international students the right to work and live in the UK and EU in exchange for a place in the university . The Government may also propose a cap on numbers of foreign students under the system of `` preference '' .",

It also found schools had more influence than parents in giving younger children the vote . The report - 'Making School Vote ' released this week - said the best way to raise the voting age was to introduce a national duty on adult voters between the ages of 18 and 75 . This would be enforced by legislation making it illegal for anyone to vote unless the Electoral Commission decides they are of age . 'Most young people ( 18 to 25 ) are unlikely to be able to sign up to this , they are more likely to be attracted by their local political representation and support - that is what matters . 'To date the electoral registration system has favoured those over 30 over 18 , ' said the report . 'This is probably because of the relatively low number of young people who register for electoral purposes , the older ones register more regularly than younger ones and so they are more likely to be registered .

They found it was possible to statistically control for other risk factors , but there was one surprising finding : the jump seemed to happen in the period just before the media stories , when depression was considered by some to be the number 1 cause of suicide . In other words , the media coverage had made depression seem more dangerous and more common , in the hope of promoting more research , rather than to warn people off using antidepressants . In other words , the media is in bed with drug companies and doctors , and so they are able to distort research .

        "Minutes from the central bank 's October meeting show officials were concerned about stock market fluctuations and weakness abroad . However , they worried that saying so could send the wrong idea to the investing public . `` We would be quite cautious in the way we go about what we convey through public announcements , `` an official told AFP on Thursday. The October meeting highlighted the importance of a bank 's communications . In other words , the economy is n't all about money ; we also have important jobs and responsibilities beyond monetary policy as well . The Central Bank of Russia recently announced that it planned to reduce its monetary base , which is the portion of reserves that the central bank holds to fund itself . However , it did not say how it planned to do so . And while the central bank has an inflation target of 5. 0 percent in 2014 , analysts have argued that the Russian economy 's downward pressure was not strong enough . The central bank 's target inflation rate is significantly above the rate expected by the general public as well as economists at leading foreign investment and financial institutions .",
