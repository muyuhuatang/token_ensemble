"Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was ""awful"" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as ""twitching"" and ""may have been aquaplaning"" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed.

"The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region.

The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces.

The ""pigskin"" campaign comes as Muslims are being increasingly targeted by hardline Muslim separatists and Islamist extremists in Xinjiang, home to Muslim Uighurs. The campaign appears to have been led by Urumqi police.

The police crackdown on Islamic attire comes just days after Xinjiang officials announced the banning of headscarves in school-related activities.

The China Islamic Lawyer's Association, a private group, said the ban was ""cruel persecution against the Uighurs"".

A senior Thai official said Mr Vajiralongkorn was expected to make a statement when he was set to meet Pope Francis at the Vatican in a few days' time. He is not scheduled to visit the country's parliament, the plenary, until later in October, he said. A Thai official said the meeting was expected this week.

But at the same time, Germany was looking to diversify sources of financing for its green energy projects as the crisis in Ukraine showed that it was still vital to support renewables, he said.

Now new research suggests that the government's commitment was no bluff.

Hamza, of Bromsgrove, south west London, denies eight counts of wounding with intent and has pleaded not guilty.

In a victim impact statement read out in court on Tuesday, Rachael told how Hamza ""shocked"" her on the night of 1 November by repeatedly striking her once with what she described as a ""satchel"".

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year. Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specialising in antibiotic resistance,","The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the service will help encourage more people to use antibiotics and to reduce demand for them.

Doctors who are using the service will have the option of setting a fixed tariff from which they can reduce.

""Patients would pay the money upfront to the consultant, rather than making appointments or paying through their GP on a per visit basis,"" said a Department of Health spokesman. ""Patients can decide where they want to have their appointments or where they want to pay.""

Currently, the amount that patients pay to consultants depends on their area of speciality. Consultants pay between £30 and £45 for each additional consultation in the GP network, for example. The department said that it would be the aim to roll out the scheme across the country.

It is estimated that as many as 8. 5 deaths every day are due to antibiotic resistance.      `` The number of infections continues to rise, and in many cases their treatment will be a losing battle.

The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific ""Ring of fire"", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano.

The study is published today in the journal Scientific Reports. It was led by Dr Simon Boxall from the University's School of Earth Sciences and the School of Physics, led by Dr Ewan Birney.

The team say the amount of seismic activity has increased by more than a factor of five since the volcano erupted on March 1st.

The research team collected seismic data from over a decade and examined the seismic data from all the different tectonic plates in the Asia Pacific region.

The findings are based on the relationship between the crustal strain in seismic waves, which are moving along the surface of Earth and","The Sakurajima volcano on Japan 's Kyushu island poses a `` growing threat '' , researchers at the University of Bristol say .

"The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel ""skins"" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was","The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of ""buildings as power stations"".

It is thought that building large buildings such as the proposed power stations and their infrastructure, and recycling it, would allow the buildings to be reused and, in the case of steel, reduce greatly the overall cost involved in manufacturing such steel.    This is due to the fact that energy has to be spent producing the steel and also energy is then needed to transfer this energy in the process to the steel mills.

An official source told MSPs last night the issue was now fully resolved which means the issue could no longer be a cause for concern.

The chairwoman of the airport board has now issued an apology to the aviation company saying she is happy with the final outcome.

Miss Lofthouse added that she was grateful for all the positive feedback her committee received about the meeting.

Airport chief executive Keith Thomas said in a statement","An official has told an assembly committee that Cardiff Aviation , which has leased a hangar at St Athan from the administration since 2012 , has not paid rent for more than six months.

The wind farm, 10 miles north of Ramsgate, Kent, was given the green light in 2006 on condition that phase two, to add an extra 166 turbines, would only go ahead if the red-throated divers were protected.

The NCA appealed for help to find him following an October 2013 raid on a cafe in the Dutch city. Police believe Gerrard and others were using it as a front for a drugs smugglers' global operations centre.

Inspectors said the availability of new psychoactive substances (NPS) was undermining recent progress. Prison bosses said more work needed to be done to tackle the problem. The report follows an unannounced inspection of the prison, near Hatfield Woodhouse, in February. It found the number of violent incidents, fights and assaults had increased since the last inspection in 2012 and levels were also higher than at similar prisons.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ""Drugs in detention are not widespread. Our staff work hard to minimise the risk of diversion to help ensure our security.""

In April, the National Offender Management Service said it did not believe the Prison Service had a problem with the misuse of drugs in secure jails.

However, in March, a Freedom of Information request by The Telegraph revealed there were at least 34 prison health incidents linked to drugs in prisons in England last year.

The majority of problems - 18 out of 34 - were linked to drugs or alcohol, many of which had led to violence by inmates against staff.

But some problems could be linked to inadequate security measures, such as guards taking cigarettes from inmates who were not allowed them.

It happened when another driver and a marshal were talking about a crash involving Verstappen on Sunday and asked the marshal: ""Did Max use his brakes?""

Verstappen said yes, the marshal replied, but Verstappen's car was fitted with sensors which registered whether he had applied the brakes or not.

That is likely to have allowed Red Bull to use that information to assess the driver, either during or after a crash.

A series of mathematical formulas can help explain the creation of the universe, from the Big Bang to the laws of physics.

The maths behind them was discovered after an international team of scientists used a computer to test what happened to the energy of the universe at various points in time.

The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, looked at three dimensions of the space-time fabric.

For each axis, there is a 'big bang' for which we can calculate the temperature and density conditions as they changed.

A second dimension is the expansion of space-time over time.

These include an analysis of all the suicides in Britain between 1999 and 2002 in which an individual was taking an antidepressant and the year before, and comparing such individuals with people who did not take an antidepressant, which yielded an increased risk of suicide of nearly 20 percent for those who took the antidepressants.

However, for most people, the risk of becoming depressed is quite low, and the benefits of antidepressant treatment, like preventing suicidal thoughts, are high.

However, in order for the vessel to be safe the ship's rudder had to be raised to keep it on its course and prevent it from being turned off. Despite this, the boat came within 300 metres of the submarine.

Chelsea have one more game at White Hart Lane after this trip to West Ham and Rooney has said he will have nothing left in the tank for the London derby on August 16.

The trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that the scheme could not go ahead while the council's planning policy against ""development for economic benefit"" on the site was in place.

It's thought that by that time the first victim was dead, murdered and placed on the top of the car, just like this one was; and this, too, would have been the scene where the victim was murdered. And the second would appear to be the final part of the chain after this one.

It is a good opportunity for Wales coach Chris Coleman to get a grip on the game after England's poor start.

Wales had a good start and only conceded two tries against Canada and then looked impressive again at Twickenham in the autumn internationals.

The players should do well - and even if England do win against Wales, they will win comfortably by at least three tries - but it is vital that they have enough good, solid performances against Wales.

"Childcare and early years researcher David Dallimore of Bangor University wants an overhaul of education provision for three to four-year-olds. He told BBC's Eye on Wales: ""It's one of the things we haven't done well in Wales is have a long-term vision for our early years services."" The Welsh government said it can consider its options once the detail of the proposed Childcare Bill is known. Currently, all three and four-year-olds are entitled to a minimum of 10 hours education delivered through the Foundation Phase.

The video, which has been widely shared across the Internet and shared again and again by news organizations since it was posted by a local newspaper, does not show what happened at the nightclub as widely described because security footage of the evening in question does not start before 6:30, but by the time the video begins, the incident is well under way.

Dela Rosa said the video, which he said was filmed in front of the nightclub, depicts Delos Santos","Kian Delos Santos was shot by police who said he was involved in the drugs trade and had resisted arrest . But surveillance footage appears to show the 17-year-old being shot when his hands are in front of him, posing no threat.

Several container ships from around the world successfully navigated it on Saturday as part of a trial run. Helicopters and naval vessels escorted the ships as part of the security operation.

The 72km (44 mile) route is meant to be completed by August 2018, after a construction time of about seven months.

This video, produced by The Independent in connection with a story based on the Canal Road cycle route, provides an insight into the proposed new cycle route.

A group of senior MPs, known as the National Infrastructure Committee, has asked Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin to clarify the benefits of the proposed cycle route.

The committee wants to understand how a three-year programme of improvements to the roads was paid for, and which benefits the proposals specifically, if any, will bring in.

Brazilian prosecutors claim Mr Toledo was personally responsible for awarding the construction contracts.

The allegations against him stem from the government's 2012 decision not to renew state contracts related to Sao Paulo's World Cup stadium.

Earlier this year, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered Mr Toledo to give a testimony to a special prosecutor investigating the allegations against him.

The investigation was prompted after Odebrecht pleaded guilty to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to politicians, public officials and their relatives and business associates around the world.

The scandal deepened in April, when Brazilian prosecutors arrested several former construction executives in a similar case involving the construction of the Maracana stadium for the 2014 World Cup.

"Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say. Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: ""Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this.

Evidence is increasingly supporting","Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say.

""People who use social media at night are more likely to be depressed, more likely to seek the help of their medical profession, more likely to binge drink — and more likely to use illegal drugs,"" the researchers wrote in their findings.

The study is the first to show increased negative emotions in night users compared with those who wake up.

The findings indicate that not all night users experience increased negative emotions.

""This is very important because night activity is only one of many factors that contribute to negative emotions. In this study, the use of social media is one factor among many, and it is only one factor among other contributors,"" co-author Dr. Steven C.

An independent Scotland may be forced to keep using a range of current rates of income tax as well as new tax credits such as Universal Credit, which means the Scottish government could become liable for paying taxes at a higher rate than the rest of the UK, and the UK as a whole.

Mr Smith is also highlighting suggestions that a further new tax could be introduced in Scotland – a more substantial income tax rate.

In an email, Prof Richard Jones, professor of English at Swansea University, said Ms Huws' speech could play a role in explaining the gap.

He suggested that Ms Huws might be reluctant because her Welsh language ability was so low, adding: ""The high perceived need for a specialist language is likely to also be a factor.""

He said that while this was probably the case for most native speakers it might not explain all linguistic differences.

Prof Jones added that in some cases having a linguistic background might mean people ""seem more fluent in their own tongue"".

If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone. Conversely, if older people stop work, there is less money in the economy, so fewer jobs. The idea is well-known to economists as the ""lump of labour fallacy"" - the false belief that the number of jobs in an","Keeping older people at work can also boost wages for younger employees, argues Ros Altmann, the government-appointed champion for older workers.

She and the government's chief economist, Udo Steffen, agree that one way to improve labour supply would be to relax labour-market rules, which are more onerous for the jobless than for the job-holding populace. But to ease the labour supply for companies, the government must also make sure that the economy remains competitive.
