An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings","The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be re-invested into the station.

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. ""In this context, green finance is a major opportunity.

But at the same time, Germany was looking to diversify sources of financing for its green energy projects as the crisis in Ukraine showed that it was still vital to support renewables, he said.

Now new research suggests that the government's commitment was no bluff.

Experts have warned that pilots should not use drones for takeoff and landing, particularly when flying near populated areas. They also advise against flying in restricted airspace, where pilots should not be able to control flying.

In the New Zealand case, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority declined to comment on the individual case but said that due to the high risk from drones, ""aircraft pilots would not allow them on board"".

Swiss banking regulators are aware of HSBC's involvement in tax dodging. In 2013 it was fined $1.92bn (£1.1bn) after admitting wrongdoing for failing to prevent billions of dollars of undeclared US tax payments from its US operation flowing into Swiss banks.


When asked about its potential role in tax evasion, HSBC responded: ""We work to identify tax minimisation opportunities and are fully committed to helping our customers avoid paying too much tax.""

"A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28% at the last inspection. Inspectors said the availability of new psychoactive substances (NPS) was undermining recent progress. Prison bosses said more work needed to be done to tackle the problem. The report follows an unannounced inspection of the prison, near Hatfield Woodhouse, in February. It found the number of violent incidents, fights and assaults had increased since the last inspection in 2012 and levels were also higher than at similar prisons. More on this and other local stories in South Yorkshire Peter Clarke, Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: ""There are real opportunities at Moorland to make progress, but the issues of NPS... have such a negative impact on prisoners' experiences.

Responding to the report,","A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28% at the last inspection. Inspectors found several inmates using drugs in rooms with inmates.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ""Drugs in detention are not widespread. Our staff work hard to minimise the risk of diversion to help ensure our security.""

In April, the National Offender Management Service said it did not believe the Prison Service had a problem with the misuse of drugs in secure jails.

However, in March, a Freedom of Information request by The Telegraph revealed there were at least 34 prison health incidents linked to drugs in prisons in England last year.

The majority of problems - 18 out of 34 - were linked to drugs or alcohol, many of which had led to violence by inmates against staff.

But some problems could be linked to inadequate security measures, such as guards taking cigarettes from inmates who were not allowed them. In some circumstances","A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28 % at the last inspection . Inspectors said the conditions for prisoners inside the jail – nicknamed ‘ The Factory ’ – were “ unsafe ” and there were “ serious concerns about the level of violence . ” In a summary of a report by inspectors issued with the Queen on 6 Sept , the inspector said violence inside the facility was “ escalating rapidly . ” Almost 50 per cent said they witnessed one in four of the gang-related prison violence . In a further “ serious breach ” of human rights , inspectors found prisoners were “ threatened ” outside the jail ’ s security fences , a tactic they say has become a regular part of gang -related violence in the area “ .

But in a first, it was issued on Monday instead of last week after the Belgian newspaper Le Soir found evidence of the practice at the Barcelona track.

It happened when another driver and a marshal were talking about a crash involving Verstappen on Sunday and asked the marshal: ""Did Max use his brakes?""

Verstappen said yes, the marshal replied, but Verstappen's car was fitted with sensors which registered whether he had applied the brakes or not.

That is likely to have allowed Red Bull to use that information to assess the driver, either during or after a crash.

Le Soir found that a marshal had written that Verstappen's car had been fitted with the sensor as a ""cost saving measure"".

The DA charges went to trial in February 2016 and concluded late last month that the assault never happened. But Persky refused to resign, instead sentencing a student on sexual assault charges last year to probation for two years, and giving him the option of serving part of the probation through electronic monitoring. In response to this action, civil rights activist Malia Cohen, who lives in San Jose and was part of the community leaders involved in the recall effort sent a letter to Judge Persky asking for ""urgent consideration"" and asking him to ""please resign"" from the bench.

A series of mathematical formulas can help explain the creation of the universe, from the Big Bang to the laws of physics.

The maths behind them was discovered after an international team of scientists used a computer to test what happened to the energy of the universe at various points in time.

The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, looked at three dimensions of the space-time fabric.

For each axis, there is a 'big bang' for which we can calculate the temperature and density conditions as they changed.

A second dimension is the expansion of space-time over time.

These include an analysis of all the suicides in Britain between 1999 and 2002 in which an individual was taking an antidepressant and the year before, and comparing such individuals with people who did not take an antidepressant, which yielded an increased risk of suicide of nearly 20 percent for those who took the antidepressants.

However, for most people, the risk of becoming depressed is quite low, and the benefits of antidepressant treatment, like preventing suicidal thoughts, are high.

Its skipper, John McFall said the boat, named the Daring, would have needed to be anchored more than 100 metres in front of the propeller to prevent the engine from grinding against the back of the craft. However, in order for the vessel to be safe the ship's rudder had to be raised to keep it on its course and prevent it from being turned off. Despite this, the boat came within 300 metres of the submarine.

According to reports, McFall feared for his life and decided to dive to the bottom to retrieve the rudder, only to realise the boat was too damaged to pull himself on board. The decision to stay on board had to stand to ensure the vessel was undamaged and that McFall was unhurt if the craft sank.

It prompted fears from union leaders that jobs could be lost in Newport.

Sir Charlie's final report is due to be published before the Budget in March.

It said there had been ""progress"" in the deployment of specialist equipment but ""important improvements to the infrastructure must be made to support the next deployment"".

In October, the Guardian revealed that the security services are in advanced discussions with the Ministry of Defence about sharing assets at GCHQ and at RAF Coningsby.

The MoD confirmed a few days later it had contacted the security and intelligence agencies ""in relation to the use of airbases and other facilities"". The MoD spokesman added: ""We are currently working with the security and defence agencies on planning for future capacity in order to support the security of the UK.""

Brazilian prosecutors claim Mr Toledo was personally responsible for awarding the construction contracts.

The allegations against him stem from the government's 2012 decision not to renew state contracts related to Sao Paulo's World Cup stadium.

Earlier this year, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered Mr Toledo to give a testimony to a special prosecutor investigating the allegations against him.

The investigation was prompted after Odebrecht pleaded guilty to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to politicians, public officials and their relatives and business associates around the world.

The scandal deepened in April, when Brazilian prosecutors arrested several former construction executives in a similar case involving the construction of the Maracana stadium for the 2014 World Cup.

"Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say. Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: ""Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this.

The study is the first to show increased negative emotions in night users compared with those who wake up.

The findings indicate that not all night users experience increased negative emotions.

""This is very important because night activity is only one of many factors that contribute to negative emotions. In this study, the use of social media is one factor among many, and it is only one factor among other contributors,"" co-author Dr. Steven C.

His intervention will be made at a series of meetings from Wednesday until Friday as he attempts to convince the Scottish government to commit to greater tax spending.

An independent Scotland may be forced to keep using a range of current rates of income tax as well as new tax credits such as Universal Credit, which means the Scottish government could become liable for paying taxes at a higher rate than the rest of the UK, and the UK as a whole.

Mr Smith is also highlighting suggestions that a further new tax could be introduced in Scotland – a more substantial income tax rate.

WA Police Deputy Superintendent Russell Swain said a short time later the dog had killed a person in the vicinity of the intersection of King Street and East Queen Victoria Avenue, Perth.

""This has resulted in a fatal, unfortunate incident with a dog,"" he said.

Witnesses said the woman, who was wearing pyjamas, was standing on her front lawn when the dog ""popped up off her driveway"".

Police, paramedics and the dog owner have not been able to find the other victim.

""We do not know if the dog jumped onto the roof, the car or someone,"" he said.

She and the government's chief economist, Udo Steffen, agree that one way to improve labour supply would be to relax labour-market rules, which are more onerous for the jobless than for the job-holding populace.

"The bill aims to revoke parts of the UK government's 2016 Trade Union Act.

The government said it was considering the bill and would respond later to ensure it could be ""fully debated"" if its protections were removed, but has declined to promise any changes to the legislation.

Tory peer Lord Heseltine and Labour peer Lord Leveson said the bill was a ""rehashing"" of the old Act - and that it amounted to a ""blank cheque"" on the future conduct of trade unionists.

The artist behind the artwork said she was inspired to create It's Time after visiting Glastonbury, which took place this weekend, where she ""saw people united"".

A total of 31 police officers were jailed for acts of misconduct, including four undercover officers whose covert work during the Good Friday talks led to widespread public concern during the unrest leading to the Good Friday Agreement.

The revelations come after the DUP's justice spokesman, Mark Durkan, asked the Attorney General to investigate allegations some gardaí may have been involved in any illegal activity.

Garda sources have said two alleged officers and a sergeant under the direction of Sgt Maurice McCabe in 2009 took part in an MI5 undercover operation.
