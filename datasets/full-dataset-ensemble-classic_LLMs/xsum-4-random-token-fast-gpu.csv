The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces.

The police crackdown on Islamic attire comes just days after Xinjiang officials announced the banning of headscarves in school-related activities.

The China Islamic Lawyer's Association, a private group, said the ban was ""cruel persecution against the Uighurs"".

An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings","The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be re-invested into the station.

According to the National Audit Office, the London Underground was suffering from funding shortfalls and had to impose a cut in ticket prices in 2014 by 14%.

The NCA said the costs of removing some of the oldest trains were ""relatively minor and could have been offset"" if they had not been in use for so long. However, the agency would not say how much the removal of these vehicles would save.

The report said that the removal of the fleet of 122 ""stub-style"" cars, which travel the London Underground network for less than 80km a day, would be ""much more disruptive and costly","The removal of the engines , which have lain idle for two years , would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital . Savings from the proposal would be invested in new public transport or used to subsidise fares .

London has spent £14 .4m preparing for the shutdown while the Metropolitan Fire Brigade will lose an additional £ 8m. The proposal follows a £ 300m cut to the annual budget for 2017 -18 .

Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns.

It also said it was considering plans to get cars off the city's road and replace them with buses instead by 2025, which would cost thousands of jobs and affect the economy of central London - not to mention the air pollution to be removed.

Now new research suggests that the government's commitment was no bluff.

It concluded that banning private vehicles from London's Tube network would save 1,935 lives, cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2,895 tonnes a year and result in the loss of 16,000 hours of lost work per year.

Experts have warned that pilots should not use drones for takeoff and landing, particularly when flying near populated areas. They also advise against flying in restricted airspace, where pilots should not be able to control flying.

In the New Zealand case, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority declined to comment on the individual case but said that due to the high risk from drones, ""aircraft pilots would not allow them on board"".

In contrast, United States Federal Aviation Authority spokesman Ian Gregor said that drone operators should be given special training in how to fly them safely. He said that the FAA also has rules covering other kinds of aircraft.

""In particular, there is a real opportunity to make progress in embracing the prison's new role as a resettlement prison, and in delivering treatment programmes for sex offenders."" Responding to the report,","A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28% at the last inspection. Inspectors found several inmates using drugs in rooms with inmates.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ""Drugs in detention are not widespread. Our staff work hard to minimise the risk of diversion to help ensure our security.""

In April, the National Offender Management Service said it did not believe the Prison Service had a problem with the misuse of drugs in secure jails.

However, in March, a Freedom of Information request by The Telegraph revealed there were at least 34 prison health incidents linked to drugs in prisons in England last year.

The majority of problems - 18 out of 34 - were linked to drugs or alcohol, many of which had led to violence by inmates against staff.

But some problems could be linked to inadequate security measures, such as guards taking cigarettes from inmates who were not allowed them. In some circumstances","A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28 % at the last inspection . Inspectors said the service offered a `` tactical approach to the management of drugs within the prison '' and `` poor assessment of the threat posed by drugs . ' .  Â£17 million was spent on the scheme , which was the biggest ever spend on such a scheme in prison . Â £5 million was on the use of CCTV cameras on wards and outside the prison to allow for improved security .  Â £ 4 .4 million was to replace water pipes and provide a new heating system which was going to cost around £ 4 million . Â The scheme would also have led to the need of an extra Â£500 thousand a year in health support workers . Â £7.8 million was paid to prison staff for keeping and searching prisoners .

"A regulation banning a practice known as ""moving under braking"" was adopted last year after drivers complained about Red Bull's Max Verstappen. But governing body the FIA has decided a catch-all rule covering potentially dangerous driving is a better way of policing close-racing incidents. Each will be treated on its merits, said F1 director Charlie Whiting. Whiting added some of the controversial incidents last year related to this issue would potentially be treated differently were similar ones to occur in 2017. ""Before we said any move under braking would be investigated,"" Whiting said. ""Now, we have a simple, broad rule that says effectively if a driver moves erratically or goes unnecessarily slowly or behaves in a manner that could endanger another driver then he will be investigated."" Whiting said the idea for a ""more general way of approaching things"" had come about as a result","A regulation banning a practice known as ""moving under braking"" was adopted last year after drivers complained about Red Bull's Max Verstappen. But in a first, it was issued on Monday instead of last week after the Belgian newspaper Le Soir found evidence of the practice at the Barcelona track.

It happened when another driver and a marshal were talking about a crash involving Verstappen on Sunday and asked the marshal: ""Did Max use his brakes?""

Verstappen said yes, the marshal replied, but Verstappen's car was fitted with sensors which registered whether he had applied the brakes or not.

That is likely to have allowed Red Bull to use that information to assess the driver, either during or after a crash.

Le Soir found that a marshal had written that Verstappen's car had been fitted with the sensor as a ""cost saving measure"".

""At the conclusion of the investigation one",A regulation banning a practice known as `` moving under braking '' was adopted last year after drivers complained about Red Bull 's Max Verstappen . But governing body the FIA said last week it would review it. Red Bull 's decision to revert to its previous car 's rear -end design may have been affected indirectly by the ban which was implemented by the end of 2010 . This left Red Bull with a choice to make on what was the final design that remained . It chose to retain the design used for the car that lost out in favour of the nose that made the difference in Australia and Brazil . This allowed the rear suspension to remain unchanged and this was the one designed to have the most aer odynamic effect . The end result of the development was the Mercedes- powered STR ( - ) which had a much more aggressive back end . Although a similar regulation to the brake-based front-end one was introduced,5.84

However British Gas says it has changed its prices, so the saving is now £43. The figures also reveal that SSE has almost all of its customers on the most expensive form of tariff. 91% of SSE customers are on standard variable tariffs, compared to just 9% at First Utility. The number of people stuck on standard tariffs is controversial, as most fixed-rate deals are cheaper. In the UK as a whole, 66% of households are on standard tariffs.

But Persky refused to resign, instead sentencing a student on sexual assault charges last year to probation for two years, and giving him the option of serving part of the probation through electronic monitoring. In response to this action, civil rights activist Malia Cohen, who lives in San Jose and was part of the community leaders involved in the recall effort sent a letter to Judge Persky asking for ""urgent consideration"" and asking him to ""please resign"" from the bench.

A series of mathematical formulas can help explain the creation of the universe, from the Big Bang to the laws of physics.

The maths behind them was discovered after an international team of scientists used a computer to test what happened to the energy of the universe at various points in time.

The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, looked at three dimensions of the space-time fabric.

For each axis, there is a 'big bang' for which we can calculate the temperature and density conditions as they changed.

A second dimension is the expansion of space-time over time.

"A study, in the British Medical Journal, showed a sudden fall in antidepressant prescriptions and a rise in suicide attempts after media reports of the connection. The team at Harvard Medical School said the unintended effect was ""disturbing"". Experts said similar changes had been seen in other countries. In 2003, there were concerns about an increased suicide risk from some antidepressants. It led to the US Food and Drug Administration changing the medicine warnings and widespread media reports. However, there was concern that the reports were exaggerated and missed out the benefits of antidepressants. The study, which followed 2.5 million teenagers and young adults between 2000 and 2010, showed an immediate impact of the warnings. Prescriptions fell by a third in teenagers and by a quarter in young adults. The number of suicide attempts increased by 22% in teenagers and 34% in young adults.

And some studies have identified higher risks for suicidal behavior and depression after antidepressant use. These include an analysis of all the suicides in Britain between 1999 and 2002 in which an individual was taking an antidepressant and the year before, and comparing such individuals with people who did not take an antidepressant, which yielded an increased risk of suicide of nearly 20 percent for those who took the antidepressants.

However, for most people, the risk of becoming depressed is quite low, and the benefits of antidepressant treatment, like preventing suicidal thoughts, are high.

Its skipper, John McFall said the boat, named the Daring, would have needed to be anchored more than 100 metres in front of the propeller to prevent the engine from grinding against the back of the craft. However, in order for the vessel to be safe the ship's rudder had to be raised to keep it on its course and prevent it from being turned off. Despite this, the boat came within 300 metres of the submarine.

According to reports, McFall feared for his life and decided to dive to the bottom to retrieve the rudder, only to realise the boat was too damaged to pull himself on board. The decision to stay on board had to stand to ensure the vessel was undamaged and that McFall was unhurt if the craft sank.

A week after the incident McFall told the Belfast Telegraph:","The boat sustained significant damage after the submarine snagged its fishing nets and pulled it backwards 18 miles off the County Down coast in April .

She was caught when a social worker checked the 83-year-old's bank statements at her Falkirk home. Cameron, of Maybole, South Ayrshire, was ordered to complete 300 hours of unpaid work after admitting the theft. Stirling Sheriff Court was told Cameron's drug addict boyfriend had pressured her to take money from the bank account. Cameron withdrew £21,380 from Mrs Pawlowski's account over a seven-month period in 2014 after the pensioner and her husband were admitted to hospital and then into care homes. Prosecutor Sarah Lumsden said: ""The accused was confronted and she hung her head and produced Mrs Pawlowski's bank card from her purse. ""She said she had been given the card to get some shopping.

"Researchers were able to make drops grow six times faster than normal by copying the insects' shell geometry. Combined with other plant techniques, the team created drops that grew larger as temperatures increased. The authors say the development could significantly improve water harvesting and electricity generation. A little drop of water may seem insignificant but the physical processes involved in both the formation and movement of the liquid are essential to operation of thermal power plants, desalination and air conditioning systems. Condensation is also critical to the more fundamental function of gathering water for human use in dry climates, a growing, global issue.

Mr Keefe, from York, said: ""I'm absolutely delighted, it's a very pleasant surprise from those whose charity it is.

"Construction on the new lane, which runs alongside part of the existing canal, started less than a year ago. The 72km (44 mile) route allows two-way traffic and can accommodate larger vessels. Several container ships from around the world successfully navigated it on Saturday as part of a trial run. Helicopters and naval vessels escorted the ships as part of the security operation. The Sinai Peninsula, which borders the canal, is a base for Islamic militants, who have killed hundreds of people since the military overthrew President Mohammed Morsi in 2013. The original Suez Canal opened almost 150 years ago and links the Mediterranean with the Red Sea.

A group of senior MPs, known as the National Infrastructure Committee, has asked Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin to clarify the benefits of the proposed cycle route.

The committee wants to understand how a three-year programme of improvements to the roads was paid for, and which benefits the proposals specifically, if any, will bring in.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has ruled he was lawfully killed by police.

The two-week trial in the Old Bailey started last month. The CPS is expected to make its announcement shortly after the jury returns on February 2.

A CPS spokesman added: ""We have no further comment to make.""

The trial is the second by the IPCC in Northern, and the first in England and Wales, and is the culmination of two investigations into deaths of unarmed, black people by police.

The first, launched in March 2011, found the case officers were justified in using lethal force on Mr Grainger, because he had been assaulting an officer with the intention of causing injury.

The following year an independent inquiry found the IPCC was ""not sufficiently transparent"" about the process and how it reached its conclusions.

The allegations against him stem from the government's 2012 decision not to renew state contracts related to Sao Paulo's World Cup stadium.

The investigation was prompted after Odebrecht pleaded guilty to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to politicians, public officials and their relatives and business associates around the world.

The scandal deepened in April, when Brazilian prosecutors arrested several former construction executives in a similar case involving the construction of the Maracana stadium for the 2014 World Cup.

The same pictures were also shared as if real on a couple of fake Instagram accounts. But a quick sleuth on Twitter quickly helped to unmask them as fake pictures.

Israel and Hezbollah are close to a cross-border ceasefire, brokered in June by the US secretary of state John Kerry.

Last month, after Hezbollah fighters fired rockets on Tel Aviv, a group of Israeli reservists opened fire, shooting dead one man from the Hezbollah cell, in an incident that has not been brought to court.

Israel withdrew its troops from Lebanese airspace as part of the June truce but has kept its forces stationed on Lebanon's northern border.

"Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say. Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: ""Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this.

The study is the first to show increased negative emotions in night users compared with those who wake up.

The findings indicate that not all night users experience increased negative emotions.

""This is very important because night activity is only one of many factors that contribute to negative emotions. In this study, the use of social media is one factor among many, and it is only one factor among other contributors,"" co-author Dr. Steven C. Davis, chairman and co-director of the Center on Health Disparities and Health Disparities Research, said in the statement.

"STUC general secretary Grahame Smith will warn that it could take time to take advantage of new devolved powers. Responsibilities over income tax and welfare will be transferred to MSPs from April 2017. Mr Smith will make the plea as the STUC annual congress begins in Dundee on Monday. The general secretary of the Scottish Trades Unions Congress believes the campaign in the run-up to May's election ""doesn't yet reflect the possibilities provided by new powers"". Mr Smith said the vote would be ""the most important election to take place since the Scottish Parliament was re-established in 1999"". He wants party leaders to bring forward ""bold ambitious policies"" that will attempt to tackle some of the ""hitherto intractable problems in the Scottish economy and society"". Mr Smith will say: ""The next Scottish government really has to aspire to more than just managerial competence. ""Unfortunately, the campaign going on around us doesn't yet reflect the possibilities provided by new powers. Indeed, the nature and quality of debate suggests that it could take some time for our political parties","STUC general secretary Grahame Smith will warn that it could take time to take advantage of new devolved powers. Responsibilities over income tax and benefits have proved too complex and divisive in Scotland, with each side in the debate blaming the other for the failings.

His intervention will be made at a series of meetings from Wednesday until Friday as he attempts to convince the Scottish government to commit to greater tax spending.

An independent Scotland may be forced to keep using a range of current rates of income tax as well as new tax credits such as Universal Credit, which means the Scottish government could become liable for paying taxes at a higher rate than the rest of the UK, and the UK as a whole.

Mr Smith is also highlighting suggestions that a further new tax could be introduced in Scotland – a more substantial income tax rate. Scottish ministers are expected to face an unexpected challenge from Westminster when they meet later this month to discuss which of the two new tax options would be introduced first.","STUC general secretary Grahame Smith will warn that it could take time to take advantage of new devolved powers . Responsibilities over income tax and welfare will be transferred to the Scottish Government in 2014 while the other devolved areas will continue in their current form .

The process will therefore not be a straight forward one. `` I think that this is a moment of opportunity and the onus is on all people and organisations in Scotland , whatever their view of independence , to work through devolution and give the Scottish Government a fighting chance to succeed . `` In the future , and after years of struggle we 'll have to look at the practical challenges of delivering change in some areas of public spending. `` In the last budget",6.23

If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone.

She was elected after the resignation of her predecessor, Kgalema Motlanthe, who stepped down over a reported $3m (£2.5m) fraud charge. Her departure leaves the party in a weakened state, with no obvious successor.

South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), has no plans to contest Mr Maimane's succession following the release of the latest results, a party spokesperson confirmed on Saturday.

Speaking outside the party headquarters in Johannesburg, Mr Maimane said: ""What I have learnt on this day, the best day of my life, is that I'm ready to take on the challenge of taking the leadership of the ANC.""

Beijing has been building artificial islands on reefs in waters also claimed by other nations. Images published late last year show military defences on some islands, a think-tank says.

A sculpture at the Glastonbury Festival which included two soldiers landing on a deserted beach was commissioned to show how the ""silent majority"" should come together in the face of the challenges facing the world, the BBC reported.

The artist behind the artwork said she was inspired to create It's Time after visiting Glastonbury, which took place this weekend, where she ""saw people united"".

"Denis Donaldson was murdered in County Donegal in April 2006, months after being exposed as an agent who worked for the police and MI5 for 20 years. He was once a key figure in Sinn Féin's rise in Northern Ireland politics. The coroner adjourned the inquest until a separate criminal investigation is concluded. The inquest has previously been adjourned at least 19 times. Gardai Superintendent (Supt) Michael Finan told the coroner on Wednesday that a ""continuing, active, significant investigation"" was ongoing. He said an individual who had already appeared before the courts was due back in the Special Criminal Court in October and three arrests had been made in the last four months.

The murder of Donaldson comes amid renewed concern over the level of undercover police officers operating in Northern Ireland.

A total of 31 police officers were jailed for acts of misconduct, including four undercover officers whose covert work during the Good Friday talks led to widespread public concern during the unrest leading to the Good Friday Agreement.

The revelations come after the DUP's justice spokesman, Mark Durkan, asked the Attorney General to investigate allegations some gardaí may have been involved in any illegal activity.

Garda sources have said two alleged officers and a sergeant under the direction of Sgt Maurice McCabe in 2009 took part in an MI5 undercover operation.

The allegations have not been proven and, if substantiated, they could bring criminal convictions.","Denis Donaldson was murdered in County Donegal in April 2006 , months after being exposed as an agent who worked for the police and MI5 for 20 years .

They include British national Bilal Abdulla, 27, from Cardiff, who admitted membership of ISIL and other terror groups in court in the US.
