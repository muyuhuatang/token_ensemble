In addition to the main character, two other characters are introduced who are also capable of time travel. But first, let's talk about them:

• John DeLorean

• The Old West

• The Road

And this is where it gets really...interesting.

But, a new character called ""I.J.,"" who is an AI, will actually be the one to give John the ""cure"" of getting cured!

Also known as Deathly Hounds (death hounds), they are undead animalistic beings that are bred in secret for many decades. While no two of them are exactly alike, they do appear to be human or other animal corpses and in some cases even more undead things. These fearsome beings often act in concert with the dead, who also worship them.

It's hard to watch a game like this.

Last I remember enemy forces were lining up outside the fortress walls as I took guard in the camouflaged bunker just outside the draw bridge. Had I had it my way, I wouldn't have been there at all. At the least maybe they could've paired me off with one of the other guards. Instead, they sent me, a narcoleptic armed guard, to stand watch for any impending attacks. Not the brightest of ideas, but then again, a lack of intelligence was the reason for my kingdom finding itself in this position in the first place. Fully aware once again, I heard the guard bellow from the tower for a second time. ""All is lost!"" he screamed. ""The enemy is through the gate!"" Perhaps the enemy forces marched right past me, assuming I was dead. After all, not many","""All is lost! The enemy is through the gate!"" ``.... through the gate!"" That's about all I remember hearing at first, as I took charge of the group. I took them into the cave and let them search. My first thought was to get to the gate. I had the idea that they needed to head to the gate to get to the outside. I knew that the main gate of the castle wasn't open, I just didn't know just how long the others would be out there waiting to get help. So, I put the group in a small, cramped cell of the castle and told them that they needed to make as much noise as they could while going forward, in hopes that someone would be coming from above to help. That's when it became obvious that things were really changing for me, I was no longer the strong, stern, badass girl I used to be.

The same poll found that a full 52% of them think that homosexuality should be legally defined as a sin.

Now it's a well-known fact that most atheists and humanists will agree that homosexuality should be made illegal because it is a violation of every major aspect of human decency.

"Build a World Part I: Inception Okay. I'll start. How about a much younger and less violently-conceived universe in which there is hugely more mass. The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun.

One of the most popular books of 2011 was Dan Ariely's now-classic, How To Live Well In The World Without Having Everything You Want. What a lot of people don't know about Ariely is that he's a serial entrepreneur. He cofounded the online research site Predictably Irrational on a $500,000 investment. He launched a business, The Decision Economics Group, to teach his theories. Later, he founded a company that turned to science for help with its technology.

He could remember the way it felt, the sound, and the look of the instrument, but in the end he could not say for certain that he had witnessed the pianist play the notes that the camera showed.

However, it does not contradict any of the other observations made throughout the film.

Analysis

In these cases, the filmmakers chose a scene where the piano was present and made an argument that it was part of a ritual. This is supported by the fact that they did not produce any of the other audio, such as chanting or playing of musical instruments.

In the case of The Sound and the Fury, a second scene in which the piano was still present was edited later in the movie for reasons that would not be made clear until the next movie.

The difference between these occurrences and The Sound and the Fury is very interesting","[ IP ] Piano of the forest Whether or not the piano was actually real was something that he could not say for certain .

In Bloodborne, the player has two types of weapons, the pickaxes, and sharpened weapons like swords, spears and daggers.

In the intro cinematic, when you first hear of Bloodborne, the player assumes that you are a Hunter, just like in Final Fantasy IX and The Last of Us. You are shown the basics of how to combat. It was confirmed in an interview with Famitsu magazine that Bloodborne is not a straight port of the previous games, but a completely new story set in the same universe, with the same characters.

Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good.

Don't take my word for it; take the word of that brilliant woman in my life: Mary Ann Moakley. Her blog posts explain perfectly how you can do this and show you many good articles on this topic on other sites that will interest you.

One of the things you'll notice right off is that you don't have to use any type of writing tool whatsoever. The fact that you can write in anything but a typewriter","How do I start ? In the words of the late , great Lewis Carroll , `` Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end . Then stop . `` That is perhaps a good rule to go by ... To be honest with you this is a real challenge and you would be much better off if you spent a few moments to think how the software you write will be effected . I can understand being so busy that it would be easier for you to give us your best guess about the answer , than to take time to think about it but if you do that then you had better be prepared to spend some time , possibly quite at length , explaining what you wanted to say and why it makes sense . A good analogy is a building and what would happen if you started to construct a building without any idea what you were trying to build or what materials you had to work with",6.68

If your story ends with the question, What happened next?, use these two rules:

If it starts out with something the character did or a fact the reader has already learned, use it as the starting point. If not, use something a character says.

You can use your imagination to fill in the other details, but the character does not have to invent it.

I hope you don't forget all the things you could do—like get a pilot's license, make your own toys and clothes, learn to read, do yoga, go on an adventure, anything. But you can't! You can be autistic, and still have the things that I hope will make you the most happy.

It's okay to be proud of your son. You will be.

The two decide to take turns raising each other in order to live forever until one day one of them decides to break this agreement. ""I just can't do this any more."" He whispered as he carefully set the bag of diapers and formula down next to the baby carrier. The man adjusted the blanket around the infant's sleeping form, tucking the ends in snugly. ""400 years doing this over and over again. We were supposed to be lovers, not each others' fathers."" The baby sighed deeply in its sleep and moved slightly.

The even waves of British infantry marched forward in strong, disciplined ranks. British artillery continued to perform its savage task with deadly precision, making it increasingly difficult for the Americans to properly form into lines. Soon the American artillery was answering in kind, and both sides found themselves advancing towards one another through thick clouds of dust and smoke, tripping over their own fallen brethren.

Both sides let fly their first volleys in rhythm with each other, filling the air with thunderous noise and the unmistakable Ziiiipppp! of supersonic lead. More men fell, and the next ranks prepared to unleash their own volleys. Just then, in the rifle of one of the soldiers, a small lead ball made in Virginia realized something was happening.

As the American infantry advanced, they also suffered a devastating blow. As the advancing British army rolled south, they took small pieces of artillery with them as they crossed the river.

A wife in old age smiling as her husband regaled the days of their youth. A young boy sobbing uncontrollably with his mother labored in breathing. These recent memories involved relationships of people. In these memories, people suffered from the luxury of beautiful love in an ephemeral environment.

Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was in the midst of a psychological battle by her subconscious over the decision of what to write on her death certificate, the only visible expression in her eyes was one of bliss. As she enjoyed the day's joy, a gust of wind blew against her face, causing her to let out a muffled shout.

""No!"" she shouted. The only option she had had that day had been to pick up the box that contained her life's work for signing. However, due to the wind, the box was flung far away, and it fell into a nearby pond. However, to the point that the box nearly slipped right through the water. She then jumped in, and was swept into a long, deep hole.

"Don't leave me, you're my best friend. A little girl sat alone on her bed with her legs tucked tightly to her chest, her arms wrapped around her shins locking them firmly in place as she shook quietly. Jenny's room was nearly empty, all that remained were some old chests, dressers and the bare bed on which she curled. In a large cardboard box, the kind that sagged along the bottom with crinkled corners, thick tape all around and sharpie on the sides were all her earthly possessions. Glaring at the box through moist eyes, she felt conflicted, a mix of sadness, anger and pain welled deep within her. She had more questions than answers and no one left to talk to. On one hand, she was rather hurt that everything that helped make her *her* could fit into such little space. On the other, she was sad that after today she would be alone again, thrown into the lion's den as naked as","Don't leave me, you're my best friend.

That was when Dawn had gotten very upset and told the nurse that they didn't know where their daughter was and that they didn't feel comfortable having her home alone, even with the guard over the property.

It's probably the same with technology. Your brain wants to make some things as simple and familiar as possible. This is a powerful thing, and your brain loves it.

The fact that this is a guy who's lived most of his life in relative isolation up in this old log cabin, a lonely, dark little cabin that was built in the late 1800s. It's where he, his wife, and a little boy used to live in. And his wife used to die when they were younger. He's come down to visit this little girl, Hannah, her mother, and the little boy every now and then for a quick visit. And his first comment to her, he told her this.

Gain gold by creating dragon creatures and placing them in their respective areas. Be creative as you place different types of dragons in different areas, just keep them under the normal amount.


Once you find a treasure, create five other dragons and place them in the same spots. Once four of the five dragons are done, place five gems in their respective areas. Once five are placed within a group, a portal for the dragon group should appear. Once all the treasure is out, head to dragon group 1 and repeat until done.


Once you have done the entire area, the goal will be complete.

A few hours in you've come to realize the characters, plot, and setting (even if it is a fantasy land inspired by a book) make no sense and you're left speechless. You can no longer take it seriously as an intellectual or even a creative endeavor. You're just confused.


And why does this happen? It's impossible to say. What we can say with certainty is that when something you love suddenly turns a corner you will find yourself in a different realm of your consciousness. You will see other sides of the world through the lens of this game that you have never seen before.


And your world will be changed forever.


Your subconscious may be as much a victim as the character you play.


Here are a few examples of this with my own personal experiences:

For a small amount of time the game is an escape from the `` real world `` , but what if that game were the real world ? The lines between fiction and reality get thin as you progress in the game .

I realise that now as she stands before me, her grey eyes sparkling like they always did before. There's a swelling in my chest, the familiar surge of overwhelming love and deepest sorrow that always came to me in those many quiet moments when I thought of her. Only now it threatened to consume me. My eyes are so blurred with tears that I can barely see, yet I make out her hand reaching towards me. Without hesitation I take it. It's now I notice the gentle smile on her face, filled with familiar love and warmth. But her eyes.... her eyes are darkened with a heavy sadness. And for a moment, it frightens me.

Make sure the reader understands that you never know what could happen. Once you have established something, never let up. This is the last thing you want the reader to do.


Use imagery or description that triggers the reader's imagination. A reader will naturally want to speculate on the unknown. It is also easy to fall into the trap of telling the reader what will happen without explaining what will happen. However, without any description your book may seem too vague.


Never put too much information out to the reader to make sure they never get lost. Remember the writer does not write to inspire but to entertain. To write you must be curious in an entertaining way.

What is a story-game and what does it entail?

A story-game is a video game that is primarily designed to teach and inspire you in some way, as well as to stimulate your imagination, and to entertain you.

Story-games do everything from providing you a challenging game as a learning tool to providing for you an enjoyable challenge that has a great amount of replay value. The most fun I was having was the ""War"" game and the ""Chrono Trigger"" game. Each of those games have multiple ways to win (even if just by being faster, you can go back to the era before the timeline you fought in) and provide for an outstanding learning experience.

Why is this relevant?

6. Hitler's First Day in the Concentration Camps: During the 1930s, Germans were already used to seeing prisoners in labor camps, and so it's hardly news when his first day as a concentration camp prisoner is in fact one of sheer horror. (That Hitler's last night in Berlin was spent in a concentration camp before he was deported to another one in Buchenwald is a little too much to swallow.)

The day is also the first time an SS officer walks into the camp. Once they're in, the first act is to beat up a Jewish woman by shooting her in the face, killing her. Once a Jewish woman is dead, everyone in the camp will be shot.

The next morning, they shoot a German guard.

The Scriptures teach that God is the ultimate source of true happiness. The Bible declares God's ultimate nature. God is love, and God's love is to be shared with all who love Him.

I pulled the wire out and it was a wire of some kind on a steel rod. I saw what was under it and pulled it out and it came back with black plastic around it. Then I saw a black plastic ball and another round wire on the floor. The ball part had a hole in it and a wire was attached to it inside. I pulled that wire out and it had something on the back.

What was supposed to be our third date, a quiet movie night in a local restaurant, had turned ugly.

I told this story on a Facebook group of women who have survived rape. But I had been careful not to say who I was talking about. It was a particularly horrific story. There was a reason the only other person in the group was also speaking to me: My story was not something to be shared lightly.

Women who have survived sexual assault are very reluctant to share what happened. It has long been known to experts like Dr. Susan Blundell, professor of psychology and director of the Program in Trauma and Traumatic Stress Management at the University of British Columbia.

If you are evil, you should score zero; if you are good, you should score 200.

It was reported as if such killings never happen. However in fact, on a regular basis such killings by the police occur in the capital area, and it is very often a consequence of police brutality.

Lao Tzu's expression changed dramatically, suddenly his mouth closed and teeth clenched tightly. Suddenly, an invisible fist collided with him and the black, blood-puddle-covered hand appeared out of nowhere and grabbed his neck. A strong force blew his eyes out, but he regained his eyesight in an instant; after a moment, he regained consciousness and stared at the other side of his hand. It didn't seem to have hurt him anymore. Lian Wufeng felt a slight sense of unease.

Whenever you're responsible for someone's death, a copy of their tattoo appears somewhere on your skin.

Most of this tattoo has meaning, but not everyone has the same, and it's always the tattoos with meaning that remain with you.

These are the tattoos of the gods, the heroes, the villains and the weirdos.

And although all of these are unique, they have no value except as a testimony to the person and time. These are the tattoos that no one can deny and leave them alone.

As long as you live to see someone else grow out of these things, they always have that value.

That same DNA is now being used to identify victims and perpetrators.

It is becoming clear to many law enforcement officials that there are two separate crimes of murder and sexual assault.

Police know perpetrators are being re-created and that crimes are not being broken up.

These issues, along with a recent report that shows more than a third of U.S. states have seen declines in rape convictions, call into question the ability and willingness of police to enforce the laws.

To help put the situation in context, we turned back to a case that was well known in Louisiana's State Police. It was also a case with multiple suspects.

"[ EU ] You are an assassin sent to kill Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu, what is your method and how did it go down? It was a Friday like any other. During my 9-5 job, I decided I would stop work for awhile since I only had a few hours left until the weekend. I worked pretty hard in the morning. It's time I allow myself a moment to relax. I was online and came across a request to ""kill Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu."" The first thing I did was consult Wikipedia. Being born in the early 80s, the Pokemon craze always seemed like a younger person thing. Wikipedia informed me that Ash was the kid in the red hat always trying to catch the pocket monsters. It dawned on me that ""Ketchum"" was play-on-words for ""catch'em"". I was familiar with the tagline ""Got ta catch'em all"" because I thought, as a non-sports card collector, it was the most genius way (albeit painfully transparent for a precocious teen as myself) for marketers","[ EU ] You are an assassin sent to kill Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu, what is your method and how did it go down? It was a lot of fun to do and I was able to get a lot of pictures and video of me running across the street to Ash, his Pikachu and my new favorite pokemon, Raichu. I hope he enjoys the film. He is one of the nicest people I have ever met on the internet. My final thoughts would be that I have nothing more to offer and I hope that the movie really is interesting to someone and shows some kind of story or meaning that I personally could not grasp but it all still seems surreal and magical from my perspective.

Yusuf. Not only is he a friend but he also has an even better personality and sense of self than I do. I also really love the idea that Yusuf's family was also on the run from the Covenant after he'd been born, and is very much a secondary character - and it was really cool to write because the way you describe and portray the character was very important in making him resonate with readers. Also, Yusuf is the main reason I decided I wanted to write Warbreaker - I just love how he'd play a major part in building the world and how he's just such an exceptional guy.

Things went more smoothly and the school was.... a school and things had to carry on.

But even as things changed they remained the same; somehow the tradition of the notoriously short tenure of its professors had endured. But this year was a bit different.

Carved out in an ancient language was the proof of a theory so dangerously blasphemous that merely saying the words out loud would certainly get him killed. The Jiate had come to the planet hundreds of years ago, claiming to hail from a distant star they called Shexwa. They were rarely seen, and never in the flesh; when one made itself visible it was beneath an impenetrable cloak of blinding light and shadow. Quickly, with the Jiate's encouragement, they became worshipped. Here were Gods that could make a difference. Rarely did they interfere with lives of the people; they simply watched, and listened.

A new novel from John Ajvide Lindqvist (aka the Nightbringer Book 3) which I really like.

The second novel in a new trilogy by Brian Staveley. There is a lot to dig into here, but I found it refreshingly different from the previous books without being as heavy handed in its messages. This was a great read and I enjoyed it a lot. Not really in the dark or sci-fi category but it was well done nonetheless.

Hepatitis C is a viral disease that affects the liver. About 100,000 Americans have the disease and it's becoming more common due to people mixing heroin with prescription pain-killers.

In New York City, officials have been alerting people about the dangers of injecting and sharing needles with blood-compromised patients, who can transmit the virus to others. The number of deaths is hard to estimate, because the city's Department of Health does not issue cause of death numbers.

In February 2012, three people were infected with the disease and one died.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the first case in the U.S. occurred in a single blood donor who lived in Oklahoma, and said it could be years before we know whether it's being spread in the U","You are patient zero for a deadly worldwide epidemic that had killed more than half of the population of earth , you can carry the virus but you are immune to its effect , you were kidnapped and put under lock and key , your son is the only person who could cure you , but before that you need to pass a series of tests to prove your loyalty and commitment to the good cause , but before that you need to learn the basic techniques and skills of combat because the road to your son is filled with danger , so do you take the chance for the sake of your son and cure humanity , or do you try to find a way out for yourself and your family ?

When someone dies, there are dozens of people they talk to: one tells them what happened to them, one explains why they lost their life, one makes a recommendation as to how to live their life better. Some are more educated, while others are less so. Some come to the Grim Reaper because of a particular tragedy. Many Grim Reapers have had no prior interaction with someone who has died. They're just given a simple list of basic questions, which they then follow with a recommendation. For most, the death of a loved one or spouse is a wake-up call.

What does a death have to do with God and religion?

Have a deep and well-crafted character. The vampire (or the person you're trying to emulate) should be someone who has goals and a long-term view who can be respected. If they're self-centered, self-deprecating or aren't self-aware, their intentions are lost in translation and you'll never get them to change their mind. The same goes for the bad guy in a story—if the bad guy is trying to kill you (or your friend/family member/co-worker/victim) and you're trying to survive against their relentless onslaught, both characters will inevitably fail for their reasons.","How to go about writing a good vampire character ?

When I read a story, whether on this site or a competitor's site, what stands out to me is what is lacking or missing? The following are your best ideas. How do you keep track of the problems? Do you have to go back and check each story again? Do you have to get help from a client or do you have a team?

The same answer can be given for each answer in your list.

Keep track of changes.

What problems do you find yourself seeing in your clients' sites? Are you trying to figure out why their problems haven't been solved? Are you seeing things in a way that indicates they don't meet a high standard?

When you find something at work or at home that you don't appreciate, ask yourself if it's good enough. Make a ""no big deal"" statement and move on.

While this happens, we see some credits. There's a half smoked bowl and a cup of chocolate milk sitting next to the computer. Then, a neckbeard sits down, and proceeds to type in reddit.com into google. As the beginning credits roll, we see him just browsing reddit doing Reddit stuff. He answers /r/askreddit questions, watches videos on /r/videos, and discusses on/r/trees if smoking a joint is more efficient than hitting a bong. He occasionally hits his pipe, and pets the kitty sitting on his lap. As the beggining credits end, we then see him ask a question here in /askreddit.

"Jesus came back in 1996. He has spent the last 20 years locked in an asylum trying to convince his doctors that he is the real deal. Finally after all this time he is beginning to change their minds. The doctor strode into his office, a calm, complete stride that he had adopted working in the mental facility. No physical uncertainty translated to no mental uncertainty - and he needed that kind of protection working with the patients. After thumbing through his strictly organized file cabinet and removing a crisp manila folder, the wizened doctor lowered himself into his office chair and swung to face the man seated in front of him. The best way he could be described is paradoxical - While his body was stringy and lean, his eyes conveyed deep strength and determination. Determination, it was evident, to get out. ""Jesus"" the doctor drawled, his impatience lining his face. ""You must understand. I can not legally release you until you've proven to Ms. Sarah""","Jesus came back in 1996. He has spent the last 20 years locked in an asylum trying to convince his doctors that he is the real deal. Finally the ""mystery doctor"" is ready for public attention and a real diagnosis.

The film has been completed and is ready for release in March 1999! But it has been held up for 10 years because the studio couldn't find the money to go to a studio in Russia. It will eventually be released on iTunes...and at some point...on Netflix!

You can't talk about Jesus without mentioning his resurrection from the dead. And if you're like most Christians, you probably spend a lot of time in your mind's eye telling yourself you never doubted Jesus was real.

So says the Daily Mail this morning on what was billed as the most alarming development of the month. What about a parallel, unannounced project of world-wide, simultaneous, mind control by 'The Cabal'. And how do you convince the masses that their 'right-thinking' leaders' don't know what they are doing?

As of the time of writing, it appears that these'mind control' projects are a joint venture between the Illuminati and the Global Elite. Is there any danger this will be mischaracterized as just another case of 'conspiracy theories'. Can anything be done to prevent these 'psychic' projects from getting out of control?

They decide to keep most of the dead; only their heads and hands. The living ones are allowed to live for the time being, so that they may benefit from their knowledge of the past and the ability to speak, learn, and control their own bodies. They learn to use the fountain well, and live for hundreds of years.

While resting at home, while listening to the radio with some friends, while watching a movie on a television in a family of four, a story about a man killed in a traffic accident suddenly came to life. Two men passed the victim walking on the street. One of them then shot up the victim. As the wounded man got up to continue running, he was ambushed by the killer who was quickly shot as he lay in the street. He recovered from his wounds and began running again. The killer then shot the victim three times before the police arrived.

As you get down the mountain, walk along the ridge and you will see a few places to stay: the hotel, one of the guesthouses, or a lodge with a swimming area.

"Instead of killing him, a timetraveller tells Hitler how future generations will remember him. In the original history it was Hitler that won the war but in a much quicker and cleaner fashion. Hitler's blitzkrieg originally took Belgium and France too quickly and his u-boats were able to starve out the British out of supplies by practicing unrestricted naval warfare from the beginning. This allowed him to turn the full might of the German military to take out Russia before they were prepared and by mobilizing early enough they took Moscow before the Russian winter set. This effectively rendered Europe under German control. Years later the world would belong to Germany after a period of consolidating the assets of Europe to enhance the war machine.

He is presented as not just the smartest, most rational person in history but also the best and the only one. As a result of this he is not just the only person to take his decisions but the only person to be able to make them.


The fact that Hitler has taken so much decision so quickly and in such a way to turn things around has resulted in the fact that he is now, at the end of the war, the most despised man in Germany (although we see no evidence of that).

As the United Nations recently put it, ""Every country should strive for a national health system that protects life and care for the weak and vulnerable, assures quality and access to health services, and promotes sustainable development.""

In the United States, the only countries to have adopted national health systems without significant reform were Australia in the 1970s and Japan in the 1990s.

However, the United States has had national health systems in place for more than three decades, since Medicare and Medicaid were introduced in 1965 and 1973 respectively.

These two programs constitute the foundation of a nation's health care system. They have been credited with reducing the number of uninsured and improving access to health services for millions of people, especially minorities and low-income Americans.

Atrocitus is from the planet Glimmerpoint and is the main antagonist in Glimmerpoint Odyssey, where he is voiced by Chris Sarandon in the role of the main antagonist (sending the other main characters out of his way to aid him). He is the leader of a group of pirates and their home is the Citadel of Fire. The majority of his crew are ex-Galaxy warriors. He uses several weapons including a large machine gun, a large cannon that can be mounted to his back, a rocket launcher mounted under his shield that he calls a BFG, and a massive beam that can shoot out from his back.

What will that be if we have all the evils, if there is not any opportunity for redemption?

"Follow-up: You are a compulsive dancer. Anywhere there is music playing you struggle to remain still. The disease began with me. As far as I know, I was the first recorded case of it. In the beginning, friends and family thought it was a joke. The doctors thought me a liar. There was no possible scientific explanation for a disease that would make one dance, of all things, whenever music was heard. It just made no sense. But when we discovered that it was contagious, that I spread the disease wherever I went, the doctors started studying me seriously. Still, at the time it was still just a passing curiosity, and no hindrance to everyday life. The unease began when it turned out that the spread of the disease started to accelerate. The doctors, through careful experimentation, discovered that the disease had a delayed onset upon exposure. That countless many may have caught the disease without displaying the symptoms became","Follow-up: You are a compulsive dancer. Anywhere there is music playing you struggle to remain still. The disease began with me. As a teenager I learned to relax by dancing to music. Then over the time it affected the rest of my life. I've learned to relax with the help of music (and by the help of physical therapists, chiropractors, massage therapists, etc.). I am aware of how it has affected my life and I am trying to take my life back. You should know who is responsible. It's not a matter of whether the dancers involved have a problem, but who is the responsible party and what is the cure,"" he added.

"The Town Parade Committee has grown far too powerful. It's up to you to stop them. No one remembers exactly how the thing got so big. Of course, I'm talking about the 4th of July Parade. It started out just like you'd expect, an hour of floats, men in silly hats driving tiny cars, local businesses throwing candy, that sort of thing. There were speeches from the local politicians, picnics, you know. Being a small town, everyone had a good time. But somehow it got bigger. Longer. More floats. More trucks for businesses (some with strange names that no one had ever heard of,) their beds full of the King and Queen of every concept imaginable. More clowns, more funny cars, and worst of all - more Parade Officials. The first year it happened, the Parade went on for hours. The Officials knocked on doors, suggesting that everyone should come watch. Most did. Some didn't. A few never showed up again. But the Parade was over, we all went home and went","The Town Parade Committee has grown far too powerful. It's up to you to stop them. No one remembers exactly how the thing got so big. But the Town's leaders have used the time between the War to gather more power for the parade committee. Things have gotten so out of hand, this is a question for Mayor Edwina Johnson, the City Council and the School Committee. But the City Council needs to take immediate action to reevaluate the Town's ""Town-wide Planning Committee."" There hasn't been a single town meeting since the election in February. The Town's leaders now make decisions about how to spend taxpayer money based on their personal relationships. Why should the residents of the Town know about what their leaders choose to do with their tax dollars? There must be some democratic accountability for the Town to follow-up on their plans. The Mayor should be accountable to the people. The current rules are not working. The Town needs to bring it together.

"After the surface of earth has been made unfit for human life, humans have relocated to the bottom of the ocean. Oxygen is now our most valuable resource. You got the gig? I asked, without a word the smugler went into a small house and made I sign for me to follow him, there was nothing in there but a big tank, How do I know you are not scamming me? I asked, the answer came from seemingly no where and was as I expected, You dont, but you have no choice isnt it correct? I could smell god forsaken ocean above us, the salt and the water vapor followef you every where you went. With a quick trust of my hand I threw the money on the ground, Nice doing business with ya', was the all he said back to me. Quickly I got the tank and slowly crawled out of the werehouse with it, there was not much in there but enough for maybe a week","After the surface of earth has been made unfit for human life, humans have relocated to the bottom of the ocean. Oxygen is now our most valuable resource, and has given rise to the most advanced civilization known to man. It is unknown if any of this can be reversed should the oceans ever become truly inhospitable.

A major disaster has led to a worldwide migration of people to the bottom of the world. The first major human expansion of the oceans happened sometime in the 5th millennium. By now the most prominent culture on the planet has emerged, the humans, which have lived in almost total isolation from other cultures for a thousand years."" - P.G. Wodehouse

"[ CC ] [ PI ] C764 ~ would really appreciate some crit for this piece. I find it a bit difficult to envision the setting. I know it's complicated, but my brain just isn't putting together a good image of what it looks like. It seems like, later in the story, you're describing structures, which doesn't jibe with the concept of cages in my mind. Also, where did the building materials come from? I'm also a bit spotty on the concept of Guilds. What are they? Where did they come from? How many are there? Is everyone in a Guild, or only some people? Do Guilds define the social structure of the caged society? The Shadow is mentioned at the beginning, but kind of falls away after that. Was this intentional, indicating the people are left to their own devices? Maybe you could work the Shadow into a","[ CC ] [ PI ] C764 ~ would really appreciate some crit for this piece. I find it a bit difficult to envision the setting. It does have that nice, crisp color and composition, but the colors are way too saturated in general. It might make your work, but it's not like a very vivid piece. Still, it's worth a shot.

I did this one and I do like it. I think it would make a cool background for your pieces. I think it should've been a smidge larger. And the colors are very bold and you could have made something far more bold. Maybe just a bit lighter. Definitely not dark. It really looks like an old movie! Great job!
