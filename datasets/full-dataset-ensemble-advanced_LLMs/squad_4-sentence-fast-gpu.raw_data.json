        "In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: \"Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)\". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis. During the sixties both books were published simultaneously in Ijekavian Latin in Zagreb and Ekavian Cyrillic in Novi Sad. Yet Croatian linguists claim that it was an",
        "The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force. Iraq permitted UN weapon inspectors in November 2002, who were continuing their work to assess the WMD claim when the Bush administration decided to proceed with war without UN authorization and told the",
        "An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is",
        "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured. Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players. While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games. Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads,",
        "In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use their own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and immediately disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are low blows, weapon usage, interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with their own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although Dusty finishes (named after, and made famous by, Dusty Rhodes) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term \"ref bump\". While the referee remains \"unconscious\", wrestlers are free to violate rules until",
        "In the 15th century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the Baroque style of that period. At the beginning of the 18th century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the fa\u00e7ade of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the 14th century, the other is that of the Pal\u00e1u. The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height. The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls.

        "Libya's economy witnessed increasing privatization; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in The Green Book, government figures asserted that they were forging \"people's socialism\" rather than capitalism. Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech. In 2003, the oil industry was largely sold to private corporations, and by 2004, there was $40 billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003. Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations, and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them. In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade. While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils.

        "Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators.

In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of \"The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing\". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots \"philanthropic\" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such as Edmund Burke and",

Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance).

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from",

        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper \"Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races\". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups",
        "The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \"favoured races\" as \"perfected races\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation",
        "Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations. For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \"subject\" (any human observer)) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their conceptual (not metaphysical) inner reality\u2014and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to Absolute Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\" In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of",

It is doubtful whether a referendum in Strasbourg would have ended in France's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous Alsace or a connection to France accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last Reichstag as well as in the local elections. The Alsatian autonomists who were pro French had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by Germany in 1871.

As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \"Zhejiang spirit\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries.",

In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013\u201314 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012\u201313 season.

Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in Madras as a representative of the East India Company, donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \u00a3560, a substantial sum at the time.

Although many Jews once had sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to study the classic literature, and Jewish languages like Yiddish and Ladino were commonly used as recently as the early 20th century, most Jews lack such knowledge today and English has by and large superseded most Jewish vernaculars. The three most commonly spoken languages among Jews today are Hebrew, English, and Russian. Some Romance languages, particularly French and Spanish, are also widely used. Yiddish has been spoken by more Jews in history than any other language, but it is far less used today following the Holocaust and the adoption of Modern Hebrew by the Zionist movement and the State of Israel.

Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585. In 711, the Arabs invaded the Iberian Peninsula, taking the Visigoth kingdom, but soon in 740 Galicia was incorporated into the Christian kingdom of Asturias.

        "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow",

Nagumo executed a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his aircraft, bound for Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20 the first U.S. carrier aircraft arrived, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from Hornet, but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; thanks in part to faulty aerial torpedoes, they failed to score a single hit and all 15 were wiped out by defending Zero fighters. At 09:35, 15 additional TBDs from Enterprise attacked in which 14 were lost, again with no hits. Thus far, Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized and seemingly ineffectual, but they succeeded in drawing Nagumo's defensive fighters down to sea level where they expended much of their fuel and ammunition repulsing the two waves of torpedo bombers. As a result, when U.S. dive bombers arrived at high altitude, the Zeros were poorly positioned to defend. To make",

He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl H\u00e5kon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected",
        "Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three",

His successor as bishop of Alexandria, Alexander of Alexandria (312\u2013328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Athanasius. According to Sozomen, Bishop Alexander \"invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary.

        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance. Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of stages of development includes the identity crisis in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of \"identity achievement\" but also stressed that the identity challenge \"is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time\". Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their crowd membership. \"Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers.\" Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers \"finding their selves\"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with",
        "Stanley Schachter formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, who injected patients with epinephrine and subsequently asked them how they felt. Interestingly, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area,",

Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong.

        "Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The",

While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose \"anything but intercourse\" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population.

There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico.

        "The body\u2019s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact",

Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca.

Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany. One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\" Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement",

This was followed by the dismissal of General Yuan Shikai from his former positions of power. In April 1911 Zaifeng created a cabinet in which there were two vice-premiers.

        "When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge\u2019s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone",

Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole.

Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog. Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit. Some predation entails venom that subdues a",

        "Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference",

        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as \"put-ons\". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons.",

John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy.

Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins.

        "The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. \"Barometric self-esteem\" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low",

Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ \"doubling\" some or all of the voices. Such is seen in the life of",
        "Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power. Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $US 4.33 billion loan (US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States, the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006. At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, however, American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in check.

Plymouth was attacked five times before the end of the month while Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff were hit. Cardiff was bombed on three nights, Portsmouth centre was devastated by five raids. The rate of civilian housing lost was averaging 40,000 people per week dehoused in September 1940. In March 1941, two raids on Plymouth and London dehoused 148,000 people. Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks. On 10/11 March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries. Many houses and commercial centres were heavily",
        "By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran",

John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom.

        "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, \"How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?\" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that",

Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181\u2013234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name \"Zhuge\".

It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central",
        "A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science,",

        "The United States has become essentially a two-party system. Since a conservative (such as the Republican Party) and liberal (such as the Democratic Party) party has usually been the status quo within American politics. The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win (such as Theodore Roosevelt in the election of 1912 and George Wallace in the election of 1968).

It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\" and he would \"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\" that Wallace chose, adding that \"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\".

        "Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts.

        "The two major types of nonprofit organization are membership and board-only. A membership organization elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws. A board-only organization typically has a self-selected board, and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board. A board-only organization's bylaws may even state that the organization does not have any membership, although the organization's literature may refer to its donors or service recipients as \"members\"; examples of such organizations are Fairvote and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The Model Nonprofit Corporation Act imposes many complexities and requirements on membership decision-making. Accordingly, many organizations, such as Wikimedia, have formed board-only structures. The National Association of Parliamentarians has generated concerns about the implications of this trend for the future of openness, accountability, and understanding of public concerns in nonprofit organizations.

They even established a major garrison in Sicily in case the Seleucids ever got to Italy. This fear was shared by Rome's Greek allies, who had largely ignored Rome in the years after the Second Macedonian War, but now followed Rome again for the first time since that war. A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War, Scipio Africanus, and set out for Greece, beginning the Roman-Syrian War. After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the Battle of Thermopylae (as they believed the 300 Spartans had done centuries earlier). Like the Spartans, the Seleucids lost the battle, and were forced to evacuate Greece. The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing",

Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged.

        "Many cultures define the transition into adultlike sexuality by specific biological or social milestones in an adolescent's life. For example, menarche (the first menstrual period of a female), or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur. In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects. For instance, some",

The fall of Vienna provided the French a huge bounty as they captured 100,000 muskets, 500 cannons, and the intact bridges across the Danube. At this critical juncture, both Tsar Alexander I and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II decided to engage Napoleon in battle, despite reservations from some of their subordinates. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness.

Shortly after gaining independence, the day to celebrate it varied between September 16, the day of Hidalgo's Grito, and September 27, the day Iturbide rode into Mexico City to end the war. Later, political movements would favor the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide, so that eventually September 16, 1810 became the officially recognized day of Mexican independence. The reason for this is that Hidalgo is considered to be \"precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the (Mexican War of) Independence.\" Hidalgo has become an icon for Mexicans who resist tyranny in the country.

        "Although the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians, it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750). John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of",
        "The political structure of Western Europe changed with the end of the united Roman Empire. Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as \"invasions\", they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire. Such movements were aided by the refusal of the western Roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration. The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d. 408), Aspar (d. 471), Ricimer (d. 472), or Gundobad (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman background. When the line of western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in",

Latin was the language of the university, used for all texts, lectures, disputations and examinations. Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic, natural philosophy, and metaphysics; while Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna were used for medicine. Outside of these commonalities, great differences separated north and south, primarily in subject matter. Italian universities focused on law and medicine, while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology. There were distinct differences in the quality of instruction in these areas which were congruent with their focus, so scholars would travel north or south based on their interests and means. There was also a difference in the types of degrees awarded at these universities. English, French and German universities usually awarded bachelor's degrees, with the exception of degrees in theology, for which the doctorate was more common. Italian universities awarded",

In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. All institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual track.

        "While medieval pageants and festivals such as Corpus Christi were church-sanctioned, Carnival was also a manifestation of medieval folk culture. Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian\u2013Alemannic Fastnacht. However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar. Both Jesus",

        "Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559.

In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the start of the \"Revolution within a Revolution\", which began with reforms to industry and agriculture and saw the re-opening of small business. Restrictions were placed on the activities of the Revolutionary Committees; in March 1988, their role was narrowed by the newly created Ministry for Mass Mobilization and Revolutionary Leadership to restrict their violence and judicial role, while in August 1988 Gaddafi publicly criticised them, asserting that \"they deviated, harmed, tortured\" and that \"the true revolutionary does not practise repression.\" In March, hundreds of political prisoners were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming that there were no further political prisoners in Libya. In June, Libya's government issued the Great Green Charter on Human Rights in the Era of the Masses, in which 27 articles laid out goals, rights and guarantees to improve the situation of human rights in Libya, restricting",

Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a tabula rasa, a \"blank tablet\", in Locke's words \"white paper\", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an",

Freddie Mercury (then known by his birth name of Farrokh \"Freddie\" Bulsara) was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. Mercury joined the band in 1970, suggested \"Queen\" as a new band name, and adopted his familiar stage name. John Deacon was recruited prior to recording their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974, but it was the release of Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 which brought them international success.

The Turkish Cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to self-determination from Greek Cypriots. Meanwhile, in the 1950s, Turkish leader Menderes considered Cyprus an \"extension of Anatolia\", rejected the partition of Cyprus along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to Turkey.

There is general agreement that US technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the Iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among Iraqi troops, which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership. After devastating initial strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on 17 January 1991, coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately. The Iraqi air force was destroyed within a few days, with some planes fleeing to Iran, where they were interned for the duration of the conflict.

As Europeans encountered people from different parts of the world, they speculated about the physical, social, and cultural differences among various human groups.

The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon.

Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests. Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains is the largest contiguous cotton-growing region in the world. While dryland (non-irrigated) cotton is successfully grown in this region, consistent yields are only produced with heavy",

Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas.

For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS, the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options. In part, these studies on the appearance of HIV in specific communities permitted the advancement of hypotheses as to the route of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections.

An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages.

A herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion.

Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers may not be able to safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent the risk of an arc being drawn across from one",

The caf\u00e9 arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian caf\u00e9s were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Cafe Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the caf\u00e9s of the Left Bank, especially Caf\u00e9 de la Rotonde and Le D\u00f4me Caf\u00e9 in Montparnasse and Caf\u00e9 de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers.

The Rensselyrics of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (formerly known as the RPI Glee Club), established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group.[citation needed] However the longest continuously-singing group is probably The Whiffenpoofs of Yale University, which was formed in 1909 and once included Cole Porter as a member. Collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century. Some notable historical groups formed along the way include Princeton University's Tigertones (1946), Colgate University's The Colgate 13 (1942), Dartmouth College's Aires (1946), Cornell University's Cayuga's Waiters (1949) and The Hangovers (1968), the University of Maine Maine Steiners (1958), the Columbia University Kingsmen (1949), the Jabberwocks of Brown University (1949), and the University of Rochester YellowJackets (1956).

The popular description of the order was: \"To keep the hair, you lose the head; To keep your head, you cut the hair.\" To the Manchus, this policy was a test of loyalty and an aid in distinguishing friend from foe. For the Han Chinese, however, it was a humiliating reminder of Qing authority that challenged traditional Confucian values. The Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing) held that \"a person's body and hair, being gifts from one's parents, are not to be damaged.\" Under the Ming dynasty, adult men did not cut their hair but instead wore it in the form of",
        "The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. \"The use of psychological",

An 1838 edition of Mechanics Magazine cites an early use of asphalt in France. A pamphlet dated 1621, by \"a certain Monsieur d'Eyrinys, states that he had discovered the existence (of asphaltum) in large quantities in the vicinity of Neufchatel\", and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways \u2013 \"principally in the construction of air-proof granaries, and in protecting, by means of the arches, the water-courses in the city of Paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth\", which at that time made the water unusable. \"He expatiates also on the excellence of this",

Both of these \"omega\" long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are substrates for a class of eicosanoids known as prostaglandins, which have roles throughout the human body. They are hormones, in some respects. The omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g., weakly inflammatory PGE3).

So worried were the Government over the sudden campaign of leaflets and posters distributed by the Communist Party in Coventry and London, that the Police were sent in to seize their production facilities. The Government, up until November 1940, was opposed to the centralised organisation of shelter.

        "Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion.

During the Reagan administration, the United States regarded him as \"Public Enemy No. 1\" and Reagan famously dubbed him the \"mad dog of the Middle East\". According to critics, the Libyan people lived in a climate of fear under Gaddafi's administration, due to his government's pervasive surveillance of civilians. Gaddafi's Libya was typically described by western commentators as \"a police state\".

The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym.

By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent\u2019s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment.

There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS). This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn\u2019t enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. When you are sleeping, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When you do not get enough sleep it makes it",
        "Nevertheless, Makdisi has asserted that the European university borrowed many of its features from the Islamic madrasa, including the concepts of a degree and doctorate. Makdisi and Hugh Goddard have also highlighted other terms and concepts now used in modern universities which most likely have Islamic origins, including \"the fact that we still talk of professors holding the 'Chair' of their subject\" being based on the \"traditional Islamic pattern of teaching where the professor sits on a chair and the students sit around him\", the term 'academic circles' being derived from the way in which Islamic students \"sat in a circle around their professor\", and terms such as \"having 'fellows', 'reading' a subject, and obtaining 'degrees', can all be traced back\" to the Islamic concepts of a\u1e63\u1e25\u0101b ('companions, as of Muhammad'), qir\u0101\u02bcah ('reading aloud the Qur'an') and ij\u0101zah ('licence [to teach]') respectively.

        "The vast Seleucid Empire was, like Egypt, mostly dominated by a Greco-Macedonian political elite. The Greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from Greece. These cities included newly founded colonies such as Antioch, the other cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, Seleucia (north of Babylon) and Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. These cities retained traditional Greek city state institutions such as assemblies, councils and elected magistrates, but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal Seleucid officials. Apart from these cities, there were also a large number of Seleucid garrisons (choria), military colonies (katoikiai) and Greek villages (komai) which the Seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule. This 'Greco-Macedonian' population (which also included the sons of settlers who had married local women) could make up a phalanx of 35,000 men (out of a total Seleucid army of 80,000) during the reign of Antiochos III. The rest of the army was made up",

This can even help us to understand references made in more modern literature because authors often make references to Greek mythology and other old religious",
        "Van Praag states that the Ming court established diplomatic delegations with Tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses. Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory \"corv\u00e9e\" tax, and therefore Tibetans were \"undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy\". Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. He also argues that the embassies of Tibetan lamas visiting the Ming court were for the most part efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lamas' large, wealthy entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials. Kolma\u0161 writes that while the Ming maintained a laissez-faire policy towards Tibet and limited the numbers of the Tibetan retinues, the Tibetans sought to maintain a",

By 1920, many branch lines had been built, giving Thuringia one of the densest rail networks in the world before World War II with about 2,500 km of track. Between 1950 and 2000 most of the branch lines were abandoned, reducing Thuringia's network by half compared to 1940. On the other hand, most of the main lines were refurbished after 1990, resulting in improved speed of travel. The most important railway lines at present are the Thuringian Railway, connecting Halle and Leipzig via Weimar, Erfurt, Gotha and Eisenach with Frankfurt and Kassel and the Saal Railway from Halle/Leipzig via Jena and Saalfeld to Nuremberg. The former has an hourly ICE/IC service from Dresden to Frankfurt while the latter is served hourly by ICE trains from",
        "Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \"Forty acres and a mule\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \"affirmative action\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure",
        "Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the \"non-breeding\" plumage, or\u2014in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology\u2014\"basic\" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as \"alternate\" plumages. Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap.",
        "Viking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements, particularly along the east coast of Ireland, the west coast of modern-day Scotland and the Isle of Man. Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland, their influence remained in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Wexford. England however was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD, and eventually became a feudal possession of Denmark. The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in Normandy, in northern France, lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, which conquered England, remain associated to the English Crown as the Channel Islands to this day. A century later the marriage of the future Henry II of England to Eleanor of Aquitaine created the Angevin Empire, partially under the French",

Early in his career, he was among the first rappers to publicly criticize the preponderance of homophobia in hip hop. The sales competition between rapper 50 Cent's Curtis and West's Graduation altered the direction of hip hop and helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold. Rosie Swash of The Guardian viewed the sales competition as a historical moment in hip-hop, because it \"highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative.\" Rolling Stone credited West with transforming hip hop's mainstream, \"establishing a style of introspective yet glossy rap [...]\", and called him \"as interesting and complicated",
        "As cellular metabolism/energy production requires oxygen, potentially damaging (e.g., mutation causing) compounds known as free radicals can form. Most of these are oxidizers (i.e., acceptors of electrons) and some react very strongly. For the continued normal cellular maintenance, growth, and division, these free radicals must be sufficiently neutralized by antioxidant compounds. Recently, some researchers suggested an interesting theory of evolution of dietary antioxidants. Some are produced by the human body with adequate precursors (glutathione, Vitamin C), and those the body cannot produce may only be obtained in the diet via direct sources (Vitamin C in humans, Vitamin A, Vitamin K) or produced by the body from other compounds (Beta-carotene converted to Vitamin A by the body, Vitamin D synthesized from cholesterol by sunlight). Phytochemicals (Section Below) and their subgroup, polyphenols, make up the majority of antioxidants; about 4,000 are known. Different antioxidants are now known to function in a cooperative network.

        "Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that",

The British goal was said to be for efficient administration but the people of Bengal were outraged at the apparent \"divide and rule\" strategy. It also marked the beginning of the organized anti-colonial movement. When the Liberal party in Britain came to power in 1906, he was removed. Bengal was reunified in 1911. The new Viceroy Gilbert Minto and the new Secretary of State for India John Morley consulted with Congress leaders on political reforms. The Morley-Minto reforms of 1909 provided for Indian membership of the provincial executive councils as well as the Viceroy's executive council.

        "The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data. If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former must be at least deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement. Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor",

        "Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses).

Spanish is official in all of Spain, whereas Valencian is official in the Valencian Country, as well as in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, where it receives the name of Catalan. Despite the differentiated denomination, the distinct dialectal traits and political tension between Catalonia and the Valencian Country, Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible and are considered two varieties of the same language. Valencian has been historically repressed in favour of Spanish. The effects have been more noticeable in the city proper, whereas the language has remained active in the rural and metropolitan areas. After the Castille-Aragon unification, a Spanish-speaking elite established itself in the city. In more recent history, the establishment of Franco's military and administrative apparatus in Valencia further excluded Valencian from public life. Valencian recovered its official status, prestige and use in education after the transition to democracy in",
        "The Third (1919\u201323) and Fourth Aliyahs (1924\u201329) brought an additional 100,000 Jews to Palestine. Finally, the rise of Nazism and the increasing persecution of Jews in 1930s Europe led to the Fifth Aliyah, with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews. This was a major cause of the Arab revolt of 1936\u201339 during which the British Mandate authorities alongside the Zionist militias of Haganah and Irgun killed 5,032 Arabs and wounded 14,760, resulting in over ten percent of the adult male Palestinian Arab population killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled. The British introduced restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine with the White Paper of 1939. With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust, a clandestine movement known as Aliyah Bet was organized to bring Jews to Palestine. By the end of World War II, the Jewish population of Palestine had increased to 33% of the total population. On July",

In a letter of 9 August 1789, Burke wrote: \"England gazing with astonishment at a French struggle for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought I saw something like it in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious. The spirit it is impossible not to admire; but the old Parisian ferocity has broken out in a shocking manner\". The events of 5\u20136 October 1789, when a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles to compel King Louis XVI to return to Paris, turned Burke against it.

Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them. Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book's effectiveness is that it \"inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion\" and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set. Young views the novel as \"an act of humanity\" in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices. Alabama author Mark Childress compares it to the impact of Uncle",
        "Copper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record. It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old, and estimates of its discovery place it at 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC. However, just as agriculture was independently invented in several parts of the world, copper smelting was invented locally in several different places. It was probably discovered independently in China before 2800 BC, in Central America perhaps around 600 AD, and in",
        "Soon Lutyens started considering other places. Indeed, the Delhi Town Planning Committee, set up to plan the new imperial capital, with George Swinton as chairman and John A. Brodie and Lutyens as members, submitted reports for both North and South sites. However, it was rejected by the Viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high. The central axis of New Delhi, which today faces east at India Gate, was previously meant to be a north-south axis linking the Viceroy's House at one end with Paharganj at the other. During the project's early years, many tourists believed it was a gate from Earth to Heaven itself. Eventually, owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites in the North side, the committee settled on the South site. A site atop the Raisina Hill, formerly Raisina Village, a Meo village, was chosen for the Rashtrapati Bhawan, then known as the Viceroy's House. The reason for this",

A possible solution to net neutrality concerns may be municipal broadband, according to Professor Susan Crawford, a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School. On 15 May 2014, the FCC decided to consider two options regarding Internet services: first, permit fast and slow broadband lanes, thereby compromising net neutrality; and second, reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service, thereby preserving net neutrality. On 10 November 2014, President Barack Obama recommended that the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality.

In many cases polytechnic were elite technological universities concentrating on applied science and engineering and may also be a former designation for a vocational institution, before it has been granted the exclusive right to award academic degrees and can be truly called an institute of technology. A number of polytechnics providing higher education is simply a result of a formal upgrading from their original and historical role as intermediate technical education schools. In some situations, former polytechnics or other non-university institutions have emerged solely through an administrative change of statutes, which often included a name change with the introduction of new designations like institute of technology, polytechnic university, university of applied sciences, or university of technology for marketing purposes.

        "Different phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase , gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH",
        "The number of species invasions has been on the rise at least since the beginning of the 1900s. Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance. Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals. An important question is, \"do invasive species cause extinctions?\" Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives, but not extinctions. Invasive species seem to increase local (i.e.: alpha diversity) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.: beta diversity). Overall gamma diversity may be lowered because species are going extinct because of",
        "In the spring of 1800, Napoleon and his troops crossed the Swiss Alps into Italy, aiming to surprise the Austrian armies that had reoccupied the peninsula when Napoleon was still in Egypt.[note 5] After a difficult crossing over the Alps, the French army entered the plains of Northern Italy virtually unopposed. While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force. The fierce resistance of this French army, under Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na, gave the northern striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference. After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies finally collided at the Battle of Marengo on June 14.

The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works. These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Leadbetter's Astronomy (1727) was advertised as \"a Work entirely New\" that would include \"short and easie [sic] Rules and Astronomical Tables.\" The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the Principia was El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de Newton, published by Voltaire in 1738. \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet's translation of the Principia, published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton's theories beyond",

Despite the similarity of name, there is no documentary evidence that Edison's phonograph was based on Scott's phonautograph. Edison first tried recording sound on a wax-impregnated paper tape, with the idea of creating a \"telephone repeater\" analogous to the telegraph repeater he had been working on. Although the visible results made him confident that sound could be physically recorded and reproduced, his notes do not indicate that he actually reproduced sound before his first experiment in which he used tinfoil as a recording medium several months later. The tinfoil was wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder and a sound-vibrated stylus indented the tinfoil while the cylinder was rotated. The recording could be played back immediately.

To enforce his blockade, Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic collapse of the Grand Army, forcing the French to retreat, as well as leading to the widespread destruction of Russian lands and cities. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France. A chaotic military campaign in Central Europe eventually culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October. The next year, the Allies invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island of Elba.

Aristotle notes that the Hellenes were related with Grai/Greeks (Meteorologica I.xiv) a native name of a Dorian tribe in Epirus which was used by the Illyrians. He also claims that the great deluge must have occurred in the region around Dodona, where the Selloi dwelt.

        "In biology, energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living organism. Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle of a biological organism. Energy is thus often said to be stored by cells in the structures of molecules of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars), lipids, and proteins, which release energy when reacted with oxygen in respiration. In human terms, the human equivalent (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500 kJ per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 \u00f7 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e.

Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801. Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places. The Law of 20 May officially restored the slave trade to the Caribbean colonies, not slavery itself.

The Eclogues, Georgics, and above all the Aeneid became standard texts in school curricula with which all educated Romans were familiar. Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1\u20132, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called \"mini-Aeneid\", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre. Lucan's epic, the Bellum Civile has been considered an anti-Virgilian epic, disposing with the divine mechanism, treating historical events, and diverging drastically from Virgilian epic practice. The Flavian poet Statius in his 12-book epic Thebaid engages closely with the poetry of Virgil; in his epilogue he advises his poem not to \"rival the divine Aeneid,",

The Marathas continued their military campaigns against Mughals, Nizam, Nawab of Bengal and Durrani Empire to further extend their boundaries. Gordon explained how the Maratha systematically took control over new regions. They would start with annual raids, followed by collecting ransom from villages and towns while the declining Mughal Empire retained nominal control and finally taking over the region. He explained it with the example of Malwa region. Marathas built an efficient system of public administration known for its attention to detail. It succeeded in raising revenue in districts that recovered from years of raids, up to levels previously enjoyed by the Mughals. For example, the cornerstone of the Maratha rule in Malwa rested on the 60 or so local tax collectors who advanced the Maratha ruler",

At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian.

They dubbed Gagarin the first cosmonaut, roughly translated from Russian and Greek as \"sailor of the universe\". Although he had the ability to take over manual control of his spacecraft in an emergency by opening an envelope he had in the cabin that contained a code that could be typed into the computer, it was flown in an automatic mode as a precaution; medical science at that time did not know what would happen to a human in the weightlessness of space.

Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded \"Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean\", written by Irving and Jack Kaufman, as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo.

In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features:",

In 1843 the possibility of war was anticipated by the state government and it began to reinforce the defense lines along the political boundary with Texas. Supplies of weapons were sent to fully equip the military and took steps to improve efficiency at the presidios. Later, the Regimen for the Defenders of the Border were organized by the state which were made up of: light cavalry, four squads of two brigades, and a small force of 14 men and 42 officials at the price of 160,603 pesos per year. During the beginning of the 1840s, private citizens took it upon themselves to stop the commercial caravans of supplies from the United States, but being so far away from the large suppliers in central Mexico the caravan was allowed to continue in March 1844.",

But by 11:00, Prussian artillery took a toll on the French while more Prussian troops arrived on the battlefield.

He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment. When this threat failed, Innocent excommunicated the king in November 1209. Although theoretically a significant blow to John's legitimacy,",

        "The deliberate or accidental hybridising of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown in recent times for economic purposes. The number of successful interspecific mammalian hybrids is relatively small, although it has come to be known that there is a significant number of naturally occurring hybrids between forms or regional varieties of a single species.[citation needed] These may form zones of gradation known as clines. Indeed, the distinction between some hitherto distinct species can become clouded once it can be shown that they may not only breed but produce fertile offspring. Some hybrid animals exhibit greater strength and resilience than either parent. This is known as hybrid vigor. The existence of the mule (donkey sire; horse dam) being used widely as a hardy draught animal throughout ancient and modern history is testament to this. Other well known examples are the lion/tiger hybrid, the liger,",

Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, \"In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism.\" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and",

        "Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology , particularly with the stress systems . This is important because emotions are related to brain responses and activity . The relationship between stress and emotions becomes especially relevant when applied to human brain activity and the central nervous system . Emotional experiences are mediated by a group of brain regions , the limbic system , which include the hippocampus and amygdala . The limbic system is responsible for the regulation of mood , the processing of emotional states , and the formation of basic drives . When an individual perceives a situation as a threat , the stress system prepares the body to deal with the danger by mobilizing energy stores and by activating the sympathetic nervous system . This activates the adrenal glands and stimulates the liver to release the hormone cortisol , causing an increase in heart rate .

Many psychologists also agree that the social and cultural environment can impact a person 's identity , and that identity is not shaped solely by biological factors . Social constructionists believe there is no such thing as an objective reality , as no reality exists other than the one which is constructed by people and their social interactions .

For example , an individual who lives in a capitalist society would adopt the values , beliefs , attitudes and ideals of a capitalist society , and thus a capitalist would be regarded as a person having a dominant personality trait in a capitalist society.",
        "Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper `` Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races '' . They go back and analyze the data from the study of Wright \u2019 s `` Evolution in Mendelian Populations `` . There they find a number of different conclusions , for example , that the proportion of the variance explained by the different categories is not as different as they had expected . On the whole they reach the conclusion that `` the classification schemes proposed do not correspond to the categories identified by FST \u2018 . This is an important study because it was a pre-requisite for other studies on the use of FST in studies of human populations . The study also led to an editorial by Cavalli-Sforza et al . in which they defend Wright \u2019 s studies and suggest modifications in the implementation of FST in human populations . \u0121isbert1 < /s >.

        "Hegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism , in particular Kant 's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations. Yet Hegel 's view of nature as an autonomous force , on the other hand , seems to contradict Kant , who holds that humans must acknowledge nature as an agent that can and will affect their lives , and take it into consideration . Kant also argues that any individual human has an `` imperfect duty to himself '' to develop his potential and capacities to the limits of his abilities . In Kant , this is primarily the capacity to understand nature . Hence the concept of the natural law , or `` fundamental principle of nature '' , which represents Kant 's notion of the limits of human responsibility . In contrast , Hegel 's notion of freedom is radically different from Kant 's . For Kant , freedom lies in having the choice to do one 's duty according to natural law , an agent 's reason for duty being his own , not a higher being or external law . For Hegel , however , freedom is achieved precisely by having the choice to be the creative power that produces and endows nature .",

        "Knowledge , for Popper , was objective , both in the sense that it is objectively true ( or truthlike ) , and also in the sense that knowledge has an objective source .

        "Egocentrism in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance . Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept , identity represents a coherent picture of self that takes into account aspects that are private and public ( p. 363 ) . Identity development is a unique individual process in which adolescents ' search for self-identity is primarily driven by interpersonal concerns . Egocentrism is the belief and attitude of individuals where only they have the right and only they can make right decisions on their behalf . Egocentrism in adolescents arises during the search for a permanent sense of self when many conflicting messages are internalized from the family and society at large ( p. 24 ) . Egocentrism is a characteristic that is highly correlated with poor decision-making in adolescents , which is also associated with risk-seeking behavior . For these reasons , egocentrism is believed by clinicians and researchers alike to interfere with the development of healthy relationships and a positive self-image in the adolescent . To better understand how adults identify healthy , functioning individuals from their egocentric counterparts , it is imperative to explore and understand the motivating factors behind individual 's decision-making capacity for egocentric decisions .",

Schachter and his colleagues ( eg. , ) had their participants read a short piece of text about a stressful event , then administered a placebo injection and asked how they felt after the injection . When Schachter and his colleagues then examined the results , the data were quite fascinating : Those who reported feeling depressed felt worse after the injection than those who did not feel depressed\u2014that is , those who felt better were the ones who had read.

        "Hong Taiji 's bureaucracy was staffed with many Han Chinese , including many newly surrendered Ming officials . The Manchus ' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for all civilian and military offices , the number of Han posts increasing after the Shunzhi Emperor established Chinese rule in Beijing in 1644 . The quota was lowered after the 1660s , and was ended after the death of Qing Shunzhi . The Manchurian- Han quota continued in the military at the level of regimental commander until the end of the Qing Dynasty . The quota system was very successful in maintaining a semblance of Chinese bureaucracy , but many Han officials were appointed for administrative purposes rather than due to skill or education . Han Chinese The Han Chinese were greatly reduced in number , but unlike the Manchu and Mongol peoples , were allowed to retain their own culture and language . The Yongzheng Emperor 's policies , however , caused hardship for many Chinese people . He attempted to replace the system of land grants to the aristocracy with an elaborate feudal system based on military recruitment quotas , and also issued new regulations of the gentry in which a person had to qualify for all levels for which he may be eligible for appointment . A person who was appointed directly to a high position would have to prove that he was qualified for the lower positions first .",

Complex machines get hot when they run for long periods of time , and computer parts generate a lot of heat when they process data . In early computers , air cooling was used on most components ; most processors were directly cooled by a fan . Even today , some computers make this arrangement more efficient by placing fan-powered air ducts near the processor to improve heat dispersal .",
        "Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths . In most Jewish populations , these founding mutations have been found to be rare , and there is no evidence of any founder effect in their genetic evolution . In some populations a single founding mutation has been observed . A famous example is the Cohen Modal Haplotype ( 3 / 12 , 15 / 151 , 10 / 17 , 11/27 ) which is shared by 38 %. We did not find any signatures of rare founding mutations for one of our founding haplotype types ( Table 2 ) . This suggests that founders of the Yemenite Jewish population contributed with the same proportions among the three main haplogroups , T2 , T1 , and A1 . The main founder effect was probably exerted by the original haplogroup T which entered Yemen , giving origin to Yemenite Jews , and this affected all haplogroup s to some degree . It is more likely that the haplogroup T originated in Africa .",

        "In contemporary society , adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform . While some of these , such as emotional distress ( fear of abuse or failure to conform ) , anxiety disorders , etc , remain constant , others tend to lessen . At this moment , sexuality does not necessarily imply a risk . But let 's look at some of the dangers that adolescents face in society , both physical and mental . There are several mental risks that adolescents face . One of them is emotional distress , which is simply putting oneself in a state of fear or distress that would result from any sexual act . Whether it is emotional distress as a result of a lack of sexual knowledge , or from a sexual relationship with someone who is very different from you , it is a major risk for adolescents . There is also an important risk related to sexual abuse . At this age , the person is usually just as defenseless on an emotional level as on an intellectual level , and so if a victim of sexual abuse is aware of this fact , he or she can become overwhelmed very easily . Even if he or she has never been sexually abused , he or she can be in a situation where the victim is vulnerable ( fear of aggression , of losing his or her job , of not being believed , etc ) .",

There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white descendants from 17 century Africans , as all Bermudians have lived on an island for the last 400 years . Hence , the genealogical heritage of Bermuda is one of a single , and highly admixed , 'multi-ethnic ' community .

        "Like the reptiles , birds are primarily uricotelic , that is , their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia . This results in the formation of a white paste known as urates , instead of the usual urine that humans produce . Because uric acid is much less soluble than urea or ammonia , birds do not have the same challenges with urinary concentrations that humans are familiar with . Rather , uric acid is excreted as a white paste that requires virtually no water to leave the body , which makes sense considering that water is somewhat of a scarcity in an arid environment . This also has the benefit of not concentrating urine which may prevent kidney damage . Birds can not , however , concentrate the urine to help them regulate the ionic composition of their blood . This is why birds , like reptiles , have few problems with dehydration , as they do not retain water the way that most mammals do after drinking . Another major physiological differences between birds and mammalian kidneys is the structure of the glomerulus and the presence of glomerular capsule .",

Cuevas , Bernardo Couto , and Felipe Segundo Alvarez , concluded the War between the United States and Mexico , and the United States acknowledged the independence of the Republic of Texas . The United States gained about one-third of the territory of Mexico and acquired the region from the Rio Grande river to California . In accordance with the treaty 's specific terms and conditions , the entire frontier between the Texas-Mexico border and the Rocky Mountains was set as the boundary between the United States and Mexico . However , the area between the Rio Grande river and the southern border of Colorado was still an enigma , which led to a complicated territorial dispute between the former Mexican states of New Mexico and Chihuahua in 1859 and 1860 , the American War.

On the day of the event , the sovereign is escorted into the Senate on a horse , while the House sits outside in the Senate Chamber as a salute is fired from the cannons on the steps of the House of Commons . The Constitution dictates that the sovereign must grant a Royal Assent in the name of the Canadian monarchy , or in the name of the Canadian person to whom the monarchy may vest . The Royal Assent by the sovereign does not guarantee the constitutionality of a bill and may be withheld if the bill is deemed to contravene the constitution or the monarch 's duty not to interfere in the functions of the elected legislature .

        "From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime , Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the forces they could wield and the interactions they would instigate , and thus predict the behavior of large objects in larger systems . Thus a very good book for those who are just starting off the quantum mechanics journey is Pauling 's General Chemistry . A good overview for understanding elementary particles , forces and interactions . Bohr and his Copenhagen Interpretation gave the view of quantum physics that most practitioners have used , and to some extent still do . 5- The Rise of Field Theories . The most elegant approach to quantum mechanics is to treat the particles in the quantum system , however small or large , as excitations of an underlying field which permeates all of space . The field may be either a massless scalar field , a massive scalar or a vector . Massive scalar fields can not be treated as classical fields , but scalar quantum fields are a more familiar concept , and are treated as a continuous classical field . Although some classical field models have been very successful , it is usually difficult to get the theory into agreement with experiment .",

Richards said that the study showed that while 33 to 37 % of the haplotypes of Ashkenazi Jews are of Eastern European origin , 59 to 63 % had Western European origins . A later study of 102 Ashkenazi families in 2015 found that 88 % had at least one ancestor from either Central or Eastern Europe , while 16 % of 2 n d - degree ancestors were.

        "The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem . Self-esteem is defined as one 's thoughts and feelings about one 's self-concept and identity . Most theories on self-esteem revolve around the idea of self-love and the love of others . Theories on self-esteem are based around the idea that self-esteem must be both acceptable to others as well as appropriate to the self in order to function properly and produce happiness in the individual . It must also be pointed out , however , that because so many aspects of identity are interwoven with one another that there is an interdependency and interaction between the different aspects . This is because of the constant interplay between the inner self and the outer world . It can therefore be concluded that not only do different aspects of identity affect one another but also that aspects of identity affect self-esteem and one 's identity as it is interwoven with others . When one 's cultural identity is negatively impacted , the positive self - concept and self - image can quickly be shattered if not addressed properly . A common result of intercultural transplants is the interruptions or negative impacts on self -concept and self- image .",

        "Usually a Presbyterian church will not have statues of saints , nor the ornate altar more typical of a Roman Catholic church . Instead , one will find a `` communion table or an altar cross . `` A common feature found in all Presbyterian churches are two identical pulpits on either side of the main entrance . These pulpits are identical in appearance and purpose . The two pulpits have a great deal of sacred symbolism . One may refer to them also as a `` choir loft '' . Unlike the pulpit of an Anglican church , the Presbyterian pulpit does not have an elaborate lectern . Usually the pulpit is positioned high above the main portion of the sanctuary or at the front of the choir where it may be closer to the congregation . During special services such as a baptism or Holy Communion , the two preachers may use the pulpit at the same time . This is a reminder that Christ gives us one body of believers and two equal ministers of the gospel message . Because it is located at the leading edge of the sanctuary , some say that the center of the pulpit also represents the `` center of the Christian universe .",

        "Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War , the effects of the conflict were profound , both at home and abroad . Much of Europe lay in ruins , and , in the case of Germany and Japan , the effects were devastating . For Britain , the war brought both hardship and prosperity . The cost , in dollars , of the war was estimated to be as much as $ 130 billion , roughly equivalent to more than $ 1. 3 trillion today . But , because the British military , despite early losses , had proven remarkably successful overall , their status within the world community had been enhanced . The war had also strengthened the empire , especially in the Middle East and Africa , where a growing number of countries were moving towards self-government within the Commonwealth . In 1949 , one year after the end of the conflict , the United Nations was created to provide a central platform for international cooperation . This new structure provided a space for the countries that had recently won their freedom from their colonial masters to discuss issues on an equal footing .",

        "Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment , it is not the case . The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and their study is difficult because memory is very susceptible to interference . However , it is clear that some molecular processes are involved in the formation of the memory of certain events , which can later be activated , for example , when a similar stimulus is applied : In this way , the memory lasts longer ,. From an evolutionary perspective , the importance of memory is evident . Animals need to have mechanisms to remember , remember and recognize the stimuli they encounter . Humans also benefit from being able to remember . Indeed , the ability to remember allows humans to learn to distinguish objects and to distinguish between good , bad or neutral events , . In addition [ , ] , it has been demonstrated that memories can be preserved without any traces of the original stimulus .

They were introduced either between the two World Wars , or more likely after the war , as a response to the popular plastic records that had been introduced during World War 2 . \u04d8\u04b5\u04a4\ufffd\u04e9\u04b0\ufffd\u04e6\ufffd\ufffd\u04ae 6 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\u04a4\ufffd\ufffd\u04b4 \ufffd\u04e6\ufffd\ufffd\u04ac\u04e6\u06f3\ufffd\ufffd\u01b6\u07a7\ufffd. The unbreakable record is a unique medium , which was developed for a one-off use . Due to the special characteristics of such a material , it was not possible to produce the usual multiple copies of those records . Instead , the record was used only once . A mould was made , and then one or two copies of the record were cut from that mould , depending on how the manufacturer felt they required to make a profit .",
        "Galicia was spared the worst of the fighting in that war : it was one of the areas where the initial coup attempt at the outset of the war was relatively successfully suppressed . Nonetheless , from the outbreak of hostilities at the start of 2014 , there was a mass exodus of refugees and internally displaced people from all over the country . These people fled initially for the mountains and the countryside in Castilla y L\u00e9on ; when the fighting spread out and engulfed those areas , Galicia became a refuge for many of them . From the outset , the Galicia government created shelters for refugees who had fled the fighting . It also created centers where refugees could receive medical care . Many refugees were housed in government schools set up for that purpose , while others were distributed to private homes . Throughout Galicia , local communities collected clothing and other basic necessities for refugees , who often came with nothing but the clothes on their backs . With the signing of the peace agreement in 2016 , most refugees went back to their homes or were offered permanent housing by their government .",
        "Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease . In a microbial culture , a growth medium is provided for a specific agent . A sample taken from the patient 's body will provide a growth medium that has microorganisms present in a suspension ( if the disease requires a direct inoculation of some microorganism ) . Some microorganisms ( such as Mycobacteria ) require a special medium with a carbon source for successful growth , whereas others ( like Gram-positive bacteria ) do not require any special culture . For example in bacterial cultures , the growth medium often consists of tryptone ( which is made up of protein ) . Yeast or egg material may be introduced in culture for fungal cultures , but blood is used for mammalian cultures . \u0531\u0576\u0564\u0580\u0565\u0575\u0561\u0576 , \u0545 .

        "Adolescence marks a rapid change in one 's role within a family . Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully , but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decision - making , except in their own limited area of behavior . In contrast adolescents may become the most influential members of the family in some respects , and may be highly dissatisfied with the decisions , or even the expectations , of parents . However , the research literature concerning the family decision - making process in the adolescent era has been characterized by three features , which I will discuss here in somewhat greater detail . One is the relative lack of attention paid in the research literature to adolescent influences on the process . This contrasts starkly with the research that examines family decision-making in the child or adult period . Although various scholars have speculated about adolescent influence - making , it is only in the last few years that a systematic empirical examination of the adolescent process has been undertaken . My study of a family in which a decision about the educational future of a daughter was under discussion makes a fresh contribution by providing some insight into the process at work .",
        "The late 1980s saw a series of liberalising economic reforms within Libya designed to cope with the decline in oil revenues . In May 1987 , Gaddafi announced the start of the \u201c People \u2019 s Conference \u201d , involving a four-stage plan . This envisaged a gradual transition to a more modern and developed Libyan economy based on a free market and private business . The first objective was to boost the Libyan economy , with an emphasis on tourism and agriculture . The second was an increase in trade with other countries , for the purpose of diversification . The third stage was a reduction in the number of foreign businesses operating in Libya , in favor of developing the national economy . Finally , the fourth stage was envisaged to be the adoption of a foreign investment law to attract investment . This process is being guided by an agency headed by the former president of the National Economic Development Board ( NEDB ) , Saleh Saadi . The reform program has made significant progress with the privatisation/compensation of state-owned enterprises , the abolition of the State Oil Corporation , liberalisation of agriculture , opening of ports to foreign capital and the adoption of a draft foreign investment law .",

        "A 2010 study on Jewish ancestry by Atzmon-Ostrer et al . stated `` Two major groups were identified by principal component , phylogenetic , and identity by descent ( IBD ) analyses : ( 1 ) a Middle Eastern cluster with a Near Eastern mitochondrial lineage consistent with the Bible account and ( 2 ) a North African group in the Western Sahara region consisting primarily of individuals possessing a Central African mitochondrial lineage . The North African population also shared extensive IBD . The bimodal ancestries presently are compatible with historical evidence demonstrating that Jews migrated through Middle Eastern and Egyptian coastal regions while by-passing the Sahara . An exception were African Jewish populations from Yemen for which , on the strength of mtDNA lineage indicators , the IBD data also are consistent with their having originated in the African interior . These findings corroborate recent ethnographic evidence regarding the migration of Jews from Egypt and the other Middle Eastern coastal areas to the northern African interior during the third millennium B.

        "Seattle typically receives some snowfall on an annual basis but heavy snow is rare . Average annual snowfall , as measured at Sea-Tac Airport , is 6.8 inches ( 17.3 cm ) . History Early history The first Native American encampments on what are now Seattle 's Central District streets were Puyallup camps in the 17th century . European immigrants starting to arrive ( and trade ) , including early fur trappers , who had arrived as far back as 1811 , set up forts for protection against Native American raids on their trade goods . With the arrival of settlers from New England , New York City and New Orleans , the area transitioned into what is now known as the Duwamish area , which was inhabited by settlers from the north and west . From there , the settlers set up a Native American community in the Central District . In 1858 , when the United States purchased the land now known as Seattle , this community was relocated further east . However , due to the rapid increase in population , it soon began to expand again , especially after the arrival of rail travel , which allowed for the opening of new neighborhoods in the Duwamish Valley .",
        "However , the battle was one-sided almost from the beginning . The reasons for this are the subject of continuing study by military strategists and academics . There is general agreement about the causes of this defeat at least in part , however . One explanation for the failure of the Japanese is that they were caught with troops in the wrong place at the wrong time . While more attention was given to the invasion of Dutch East Indies and to the invasion of Malaya , virtually no troops were stationed to guard or attack Thailand , while much of the fleet was committed to the fight against the United States . Meanwhile Britain , with a few aircraft , was unable to prevent the entry of Japan on the Thai side , as Japanese planes attacked the British airbase in Hong Kong . In addition , with Thailand and with the backing of the Japanese on its land mass , Thailand was able to launch attacks from its borders against the Allies .

        "The European concept of `` race '' , along with many of the ideas now associated with the term , arose at the time of the scientific revolution , which began in the mid-17th century . The term `` race `` was used to refer to distinct biological groups that were different from those of other peoples in various aspects .

        "After Cassander 's death in 298 BCE , however , Demetrius , who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet , invaded Macedon , seized the Macedonian throne ( as Demetrius II of Macedon ) , and restored the previous territorial integrity of that state ( with the exception of Epiros and Thessaly ) . He was thus the first of the Hellenistic kings to expand Macedonian territory , creating a great empire that stretched as far as the Persian Gulf . This expansion included the complete destruction of Epiros , except Olynthus , and the subsequent colonisation of this area by Macedonian citizens . From here on , however , Demetrius \u2019 reign is marred with treachery , rebellion and civil war . During his struggle against Pyrrhus , his Macedonian subjects became more and more restive . In 285 he fell a victim to the intriguing , rebellious queen , Phthia , who had him put to death while he was on his way to Epirus to meet Pyrrhus , and handed over Macedon. The next king , Antigonus , had the body of his late brother put to flight and placed him in the tomb at Nemea .",
        "Established bands made something of a comeback in the mid-1980s . After an 8-year separation , Deep Purple returned with the classic Machine Head line-up to produce Perfect Strangers ( 1984 ) and its follow-up The House of Blue Light ( 1987 ) . As a 26-year-old I was a late bloomer and had never really known about early Purple . So when I first heard these two , and later Slaves and Masters ( 1990 ) , I was struck by a strong Purple vibe . Deep Purple were at the centre of the heavy metal scene since before I was born and it remains one of my favourite bands . This is not so obvious on Slaves and Masters , a band that has moved on to a more melodic , blues-based sound . Ian Gillan 's throat - the most expressive instrument in rock - is still in remarkably good shape and he has a tendency to break out of a tune and belt everything out of the park . The rambling album tracks are not as convincing as the epic and short-but-sweet title track or 'No One Came ' .",
        "Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free period , plenty of sunshine , and a moderate rainfall , usually from 600 to 1,200 mm ( 24 to 47 in ) . Cotton does not tolerate excessive wet ness , nor does it withstand long periods of dry . It thrives wherever these conditions exist . Cotton requires warm soil temperatures to produce satisfactory yields and quality , with 65 to 70 \u00b0F ( 18 to 21\u00b0C ) being the optimal temperature for seed germination . The optimum soil pH for cotton growth is 6. 5 . The ideal range for pH is 6 . Cotton , also called upland cotton , is a native of tropical America and has become a fiber of worldwide importance . Cotton grows in a variety of climatic conditions . Most U. S . cotton is grown on the warm South central United States . Cotton is generally a self pollinating plant and therefore normally does not require hand pollination . < /s >. Cotton is a major export commodity in Pakistan .",
        "Mary 's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium . Beginning with St. Maximus the Confessor in the seventh century , however , this doctrine acquired prominence , and some theologians ascribed to her a `` preservation from sin '' from the very womb ( preservationis a sinu ) . In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , the issue became the most discussed one in the Orient . The Greek controversy over the Assumption began in 1274 , when the emperor Michael Paleologos made a vow not to marry until the relics of Mary were discovered at Ephesus . He asked the patriarch of Constantinople , Germanos I , whether relics had been discovered at Ephesus . Germanos , who was the first Greek Catholic patriarch , was unwilling to give him an answer which might be interpreted as his own opinion . He therefore replied simply that such a question should be put to an ecumenical council . The emperor , encouraged by Barlaam of Calabria , a Latin theologian from the West , summoned the Synod of Blachernae in 1274 .",

All six were charged with conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office by paying police officers for information , and all six pleaded not guilty . The prosecution claimed that officers at The Sun had regularly committed corruption offences in order to find and reveal out information about celebrities and others of interest to the publication . The Crown Prosecution Service , based on the evidence of two female officers who worked for The Suns investigative team , said this had created a culture where the officers received gifts or cash in exchange for compromising evidence . One of those arrested and charged was then-photojournalist Alan Mullally , who was also a staff photographer with The Sun newspaper . Mullally , who worked at The Sun for over 20 years , was charged with conspiracy with another Sun journalist ( Gerard Brand and others ) in July 2013 , a year after the Sun went bust.

        "The initial military maneuvers began in September 1806 . In a notable letter to Marshal Soult detailing the plan for the campaign , Napoleon described the essential features of Napoleonic warfare : `` . In no circumstances are troops ever to stand still without occupation . '' In order to achieve this aim of occupying enemy territory , Napoleon sought to deploy troops in columns and waves . Throughout the maneuvers , the army practiced infantry and artillery fire , marching , counter-attacking , pursuit and encirclement . This practice laid the foundations for the Napoleonic army . Flavius Josephus ( 7th century A. D. ) reported that the Romans practiced maneuvers to hone and maintain battle skills , and the first military encampment in the United States , to learn the art of war , was established in Cambridge , Massachusetts , in 1637. However , these military camps are different from the `` cantonments `` established by Napoleon to train his army . Cantonment , meaning `` camp , `` came from military parlance and began as a temporary encampment until 1793 when Napoleon , then commander of the National Guard , converted the cantonments into training camps . In 1794 , he ordered all troops to form cantonments at a set time .",

Apple concluded that Intel 's CISC ( Complex Instruction Set Computer ) architecture ultimately was n't adequate for its needs and decided to go to its own design , the ARM core . However , the company later changed his mind . The ARM core was developed by ARM Limited . ARM is a UK company that was not successful in developing its own processor design ; instead , the company developed a smaller - scale instruction set designed specifically for embedded computers and other applications that did not require high performance .

        "Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people . An exclusive boundary arises , for example , when a person adopts a marker by choice , a member of a minority group , on the inside of a minority group who does n \u2019 t feel at ease with his culture ( Ferd , 2013 ) . It follows that \u201c it is important to understand the nuances and the meanings attributable to the concept of exclusion in order to try to avoid the inexorable effects linked to marginality \u201c ( Sofia Lia ,. 2007 , p. 40 ) .

        "To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive \u2013 mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet . While the earliest mammals were probably predators , different species have adapted to eating a range of different foods . Most mammals belong to the placental group ; placentals are able to feed their young from an internal organ that facilitates the transfer of substances from one organism to another . In the case of humans , the placenta provides oxygen and nutrients to the developing baby through its umbilical cord . Some placental mammals use this adaptation to pass antibodies through to the child while it is developing in the womb . Another benefit of using a placenta is to protect mothers from the risk of contracting an infection from the foetus . There are also other groups of mammals that do not use a placenta to nourish their young . One example are marsupials , in which the embryos are only semi\u2013developed when born . Because reproduction is energy intensive , it is assumed that reproductively active species should have more developed metabolisms than other animals . However , there is an apparent trend where the more developed and complex the metabolism , the less energy the organism can produce as a whole .",

        "To prevent the risk of out-of-phase supplies mixing , sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated . This is achieved by Neutral Sections ( Neutral Grounds ) . The current leaving a neutral section must be the same as the current returning . In addition to Neutral Sections , the feeder station supply to sections of line is often divided into two separate circuits so that any faults in either will ensure current does not carry to other sections of line . Another important concern is the amount of short circuit current delivered to a feeder station . This will decide the design of the switchgear at the station and the size of the transformers used . The short circuit current on an oil-free , dry circuit is usually limited to 0. 16 A but if there are insulated conductors that are likely to be broken under fault conditions , it may be necessary to limit this to 0. 2 A . The minimum size of a transformer is dependent on the short circuit current delivered .",

        "In the wake of the Coventry Blitz , there was widespread agitation from the Communist Party over the need for bomb-proof shelters . Many Londoners , in particular , took their protests all the way to the Prime Minister 's door . 1942 saw widespread calls for nationalisation of private shelters , leading to a huge backlash against the capital 's bomb sites . Many shelters , with their capacity only to protect from fire , could shelter only a very small proportion of the city 's bomb-prone population . The ' bomb-proof shelter ' was invented by a former British Air Marshall , who had originally thought of it as a way of protecting London 's vulnerable aircraft . The shelter was constructed from steel , was high and , and was considered to be'bullet proof ' . It had an effective range of twenty miles , and was the first and only successful air-raid alarm to be invented . - Source : The National Archives , via a report , dated the 22nd of March 1942 Source : The National Archives , via a report dated the 12th March 1942 Source : The National. # # People also ask How many shelters were there during world war 2 ?

Truman 's order created a body to investigate the causes of racial discrimination and to make recommendations for action . President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed a national commission to study race relations between whites and blacks and to make policy proposals . The commission , of 14 members including 6 black members , was formed on October 18 , 1967 and reported in 1968 . The Civil Rights Act of 1968 , often called the Fair Housing Act or Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 , was President Johnson 's response to the commission report and a companion measure was passed by the US Congress . The passage of the laws was the culmination of a movement that had begun a quarter of a century earlier and had included court decisions and grassroots legislation . Although both measures were passed and signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson , the initial efforts of civil rights activists were spearheaded by the Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) , with its project of Freedom Rides.",
        "Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom . Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological , philosophical , and political agendas since Luther refused to support the Emperor Charles V 's plan to use the Reichstag ( a. k. a. Diet ) as an instrument for his imperial religious policy . The Protestants established their church as a political organization in the early 17th century . The Church of Sweden , the Church of Norway , and the Lutheran Church in Finland were in direct competition with the Catholic state church . In 1571 , when the Polish Diet convened an Assembly of Churches to resolve a religious conflict , the church came to an agreement with the national government . Protestants gained some influence by organizing an alliance and joining the anti-Catholic coalition led by Frederick III of the Palatinate , Elector of the Rhine . Protestants , however , were eventually overpowered by other forces and in 1648 , in the Treaty of Westphalia , the Protestant states were obliged to recognize the Catholic state church , the Roman Catholic Church . Freedom of conscience was not recognized either .",

        "Chapter XI deals with evidence from biogeography , starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions can not be explained by environmental differences alone ; for example , the same plants grow in both England and China , although the two regions are very different in climate . In addition to species differences , however , there is a consistent trend of increasing genetic discontinuity as one travels farther south , and the degree of genetic discontinuity within different island communities . Darwin also argued that it is not reasonable to assume that birds and mammals from similar climates , such as the English and Indian pipits , can have such different plumage without some genetic reason . This is the evidence that shows that species , from different regions , have been modified to suit their new environment . The fact that the process extends throughout the world suggests to Darwin that the modifications are similar and due to similar causes ( evolution ) . Finally , this also points to the development of a common ancestry on the basis of evolution .",

In order to build an economy on the foundation of the southern planters , the reconstruction period implemented land distribution system where freed slaves occupied unused land to develop self-sufficient livelihoods .

        "As cellular metabolism/energy production requires oxygen , potentially damaging ( e.g. , mutation causing ) compounds known as free radicals can form . Most of these are oxidizers ( i.e. , atoms or compounds that strip electrons from other molecules ) . While some are harmless , others can alter protein , DNA and other molecules , causing harmful changes that lead to tissue injury and the development of certain diseases . A cell \u2019 s ability to withstand free radicals and maintain the delicate balance of metabolic processes ( so -called \u201c oxidative stress \u201d ) is regulated by endogenous compounds known as antioxidants ( usually protein or phenol based ) that \u201c neutralize \u201d potentially damaging free radicals . However , due to natural wear and tear , aging , or disease , ineffective antioxidant defense mechanisms lead to increased oxidative stress and cellular damage . While the body can replenish these antioxidants , the aging process makes it progressively more difficult to restore their supply . It has been shown that people who have higher levels of oxidative stress are more likely to suffer from a wide range of diseases including cardiovascular disease , arthritis , diabetes and some cancers .",

        "The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s , for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about physical experiences . The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ends by the early 1940s ; this phase was due to be replaced by the reductionist phase , as it became clear that scientific statements about macroscopic and microscopic objects could not be. However , we have seen that the arguments that ended the phenomenalist phase of empiricism and replaced it with the reductionist phase are all circular : they rely for their force on the meaning of concepts in the theory that is supposed to replace the phenomenalist. The first step in the reductionist phase is to find macroscopic concepts that will be used to replace all of the phenomenalist concepts \u2014 that is , concepts that will do most of the work in accounting for phenomenalist statements . If that is done , the argument that replaces the phenomenalist theory with the reductionist theory has the form : ( 1 ) The reductionist theory is complete .

The mosaic pictures on the walls are usually more ornate as those on the floor ; however , the scenes depicted are always scenes of daily life , mostly court life , in the Byzantine fashion . The scenes from hunting and daily life usually include human figures and animals , including depictions of horses , which indicate that the artists were highly skilled in portraying animals . However , the horses show no signs of their use in warfare , nor the camels ; rather these animals are shown as animals which are often depicted in Roman mosaics .

Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies , he decided to strike first and decisively . In a major act of pre-emptive self-defense , he sent a series of detachments of 5,000 soldiers and 1,500 horsemen down the coast into Spain . The objective of the troops , under Marshal Michel Ney , was to capture the strategically important port city of C\u00e1diz on the east coast of Spain and to occupy it as a base from which to attack England . The campaign to occupy C\u00e1diz and then to besiege it during the summer of 1805 thus began as a major expeditionary raid against Spain . The strategy of Napoleonic France in 1805 was an attempt to avoid a two - front war .

        "The Defence Committee\u2014Third Report `` Defence Equipment 2009 '' cites an article from the Financial Times website stating that the Chief of Defence Materiel , General Sir Kevin O \u2019 Connor , has said that there is a `` 'redundancy ' of more than 30 % of the British Army 's current equipment ( of which the infantry battalions comprise about 50 % ) . The problem has been caused by defence budget cuts initiated by the United Kingdom before the election of the Conservative Party in 1997 with a view to reducing the military strength . However , more recent spending proposes that the army will not be reduced below 102,000 personnel as early as 2017 \u2014 a figure that is to be reached in just 82 % of the time. It is thus unsurprising that there are many gaps in the equipment that are required to be fielded before that year . The Defence Committee concludes from this that the Department of Defence can not fulfil its obligation to the Army to equip it adequately\u2014not least in view of the fact that the army is expected to be at only 50 % strength by 2016 . This is an important issue , insofar as it affects all British soldiers , but it is particularly critical for infantry soldiers in the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers .",
        "One of the notable authors of esoteric interpretation prior to the 12th century is Sulami ( d. 1021 ) without whose work the majority of very early Sufi commentaries would not have survived in writing . Esoteric interpretation One of the most obvious examples of `` esoteric interpretation '' is the interpretation of Quranic Arabic . In the early annals of Arabic literature , a number of stories circulated attributing to the Prophet and his early companions the usage of a complex symbolic system through which they communicated various spiritual concepts . In many parts of the world , especially among Muslims , women veils which cover the head and face are being abandoned . In these cases , `` veil \u201d seems to be something that Muslims need to return to . Many Westerners are baffled by the Muslim emphasis on the veil . In certain Muslim nations , the wearing of the veil is an expression of women \u2019 s dignity and respectability . Thus , a Muslim woman might cover her hair because she has made a commitment to the faith . The veil , as in the past , symbolizes the sacred value of the physical body which is not to be displayed by women to other women , as is the practice among men , but which , conversely , is a privilege to be enjoyed exclusively.",

The former used to be seen as low status institutions and their courses as less academic in nature than what could be found at universities . This did not mean though that they were exclusively involved in vocational education and training . Around the world many polytechnics were quite selective in terms of applicants . To have access to this type of institution students often had to gain a high school diploma . In more recent years , however , this stereotype that polytechnics / institutes of technology are associated with vocational education and training rather than with academic learning has been challenged . The academic standing of the institutions has risen and many students attend those institutions that had been regarded in the past as low status institutions in the field of higher education .

An interesting aspect of this typing method is that it does not require the use of a capital key to start a sentence , nor does it require you to have a dedicated period space . For example , the sentence ` I like tea . ` could be typed by first lowering the shift paddle to the lower position , then typing ` i l k t . ` .

        "In biology , energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living organism . Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development , as well as for maintaining life functions such as reproduction , thermoregulation and movement . The energy for all these processes is absorbed from the environment primarily as a result of photosynthesis in plants . Energy is also a measure of work . An energy level is the set of states of a quantum mechanical system that corresponds to a particular value of an energy . The state of a quantum mechanical system is described by a wave function , which is the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation . # # Classical versus quantum biology Classical biology is based on the premise that the macroscopic world and its phenomena consist of things that are always either whole or complete , and can never be disassembled into. more fundamental units . Quantum biology , on the other hand , is based on the premise that microscopic phenomena , like atoms and electrons , possess discrete energies . The idea is that life emerges only under conditions of low entropy .",

Byzantine and Roman art had considerable influence , and Carolingian artists were interested in copying old classical manuscripts . # # How have modern artists been influenced by renaissance , medieval and baroque art ? These types of work are very important in the development of modern art because they helped many artists such as William Turner , Claude Monet , August.
