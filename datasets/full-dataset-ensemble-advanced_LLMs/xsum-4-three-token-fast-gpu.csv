"The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region.

The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces.

Now new research suggests that the government's commitment was no bluff.

Aviation experts say the case of Mr MacLellan's collision is an excellent example of how drones could hinder safety. Experts have warned that pilots should not use drones for takeoff and landing, particularly when flying near populated areas. They also advise against flying in restricted airspace, where pilots should not be able to control flying.

In the New Zealand case, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority declined to comment on the individual case but said that due to the high risk from drones, ""aircraft pilots would not allow them on board"".

In contrast, United States Federal Aviation Authority spokesman Ian Gregor said that drone operators should be given special training in how to fly them safely. He said that the FAA also has rules covering other kinds of aircraft.

But the main Syrian opposition group opposed the deal, accusing Tehran of allowing Assad's forces to enter the areas.

It is unclear whether the announcement of the deal would have any effect on the fighting in the two areas.

The Syrian government has said rebel fighters killed more than 10 people in air strikes overnight as it tries to enforce the new zones. It accused rebel fighters of killing the children of a Kurdish-led militia group.

The Syrian army, backed by Russian forces, says it has taken ground from rebel groups it says were planning attacks on its strongholds outside the two new zones.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme.

Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes.

UBS made the announcement as it revealed a better-than-expected 13% rise in fourth quarter net profit to 963m Swiss francs (ÃÂ£683.9m). However, it warned the increased value of the Swiss franc relative to other currencies, following the Swiss National Bank's decision to abandon the cap on the currency's value against the","The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called ""bearer bonds"". These bonds can be transferred without registering ownership, enabling wealthy clients to move large sums into low tax jurisdictions, without revealing their identity.

While it is not known from this case whether the US authorities have conducted a full investigation into the firm's role in the tax evasion scandal, an investigation into the firm's accounts could provide new clues.

Swiss banking regulators are aware of HSBC's involvement in tax dodging. In 2013 it was fined $1.92bn (Â£1.1bn) after admitting wrongdoing for failing to prevent billions of dollars of undeclared US tax payments from its US operation flowing into Swiss banks.


When asked about its potential role in tax evasion, HSBC responded: ""We work to identify tax minimisation opportunities and are fully committed to helping our customers avoid paying too much tax.""

Ms Park has also been charged over her relationship with Ms Choi after a new judge overseeing the corruption case revealed that three former presidential aides - Ms Park's former chief secretary, who has also been accused of collusion with Ms Choi, and another political ally, Choi Soon-sil - also provided gifts to Ms Choi.

Police are lining the streets and telling protesters to move along in an attempt to minimise disruption in the capital's centre. Despite the wet weather conditions, tens of thousands of protesters poured out onto the streets demanding that their pacifist constitution be protected and calling for the prime minister to step down. The streets were lined with police vans but given how unprecedented it is for the Japanese to be so vocal, there was never any fear that things would get out of hand.

The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house and will be put to a vote in the upper house, the upper house of parliament.

Japan is currently bound by a ban on using force abroad following its defeat in World War Two. In 2002, the constitutional court overturned the ban as violating democracy.

Critics say the move could pave the way for Japan to act on Chinese claims to a group of islands in an area called the East China Sea.

The decision by the lower house comes just over a week after two Japanese members of parliament voiced concerns over the legislation's wording, amid fears that it would permit the military to be used on foreign soil for the first time.

During the debate, one lawmaker said that he did not want the deployment of US Marines to be discussed at this bill-reading session, citing ""a national crisis"" in the United States and the need","The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight abroad for the first time since World War Two .

He said the government had shown ""utter neglect"" by refusing to guarantee a new deal to junior doctors over the issue of contracts.

The Tory-led Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he would not budge on the contract talks, saying he would make sure the NHS was protected, including by imposing a three-year contract on junior doctors.

"A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28% at the last inspection. Inspectors said the availability of new psychoactive substances (NPS) was undermining recent progress. Prison bosses said more work needed to be done to tackle the problem.

The majority of problems - 18 out of 34 - were linked to drugs or alcohol, many of which had led to violence by inmates against staff.

But in a first, it was issued on Monday instead of last week after the Belgian newspaper Le Soir found evidence of the practice at the Barcelona track.

It happened when another driver and a marshal were talking about a crash involving Verstappen on Sunday and asked the marshal: ""Did Max use his brakes?""

Verstappen said yes, the marshal replied, but Verstappen's car was fitted with sensors which registered whether he had applied the brakes or not.

That is likely to have allowed Red Bull to use that information to assess the driver, either during or after a crash.

Le Soir found that a marshal had written that Verstappen's car had been fitted with the sensor as a ""cost saving measure"".

A series of mathematical formulas can help explain the creation of the universe, from the Big Bang to the laws of physics.

The maths behind them was discovered after an international team of scientists used a computer to test what happened to the energy of the universe at various points in time.

The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, looked at three dimensions of the space-time fabric.

For each axis, there is a 'big bang' for which we can calculate the temperature and density conditions as they changed.

A second dimension is the expansion of space-time over time.

These include an analysis of all the suicides in Britain between 1999 and 2002 in which an individual was taking an antidepressant and the year before, and comparing such individuals with people who did not take an antidepressant, which yielded an increased risk of suicide of nearly 20 percent for those who took the antidepressants.

However, for most people, the risk of becoming depressed is quite low, and the benefits of antidepressant treatment, like preventing suicidal thoughts, are high.

Its skipper, John McFall said the boat, named the Daring, would have needed to be anchored more than 100 metres in front of the propeller to prevent the engine from grinding against the back of the craft. However, in order for the vessel to be safe the ship's rudder had to be raised to keep it on its course and prevent it from being turned off. Despite this, the boat came within 300 metres of the submarine.

According to reports, McFall feared for his life and decided to dive to the bottom to retrieve the rudder, only to realise the boat was too damaged to pull himself on board. The decision to stay on board had to stand to ensure the vessel was undamaged and that McFall was unhurt if the craft sank.

A CPS spokesman added: ""We have no further comment to make.""

The trial is the second by the IPCC in Northern, and the first in England and Wales, and is the culmination of two investigations into deaths of unarmed, black people by police.

The first, launched in March 2011, found the case officers were justified in using lethal force on Mr Grainger, because he had been assaulting an officer with the intention of causing injury.

"Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say. Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: ""Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this. ""It is important that we understand how social media use relates to these. Evidence is increasingly supporting","Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say.

The study is the first to show increased negative emotions in night users compared with those who wake up.

The findings indicate that not all night users experience increased negative emotions.

""This is very important because night activity is only one of many factors that contribute to negative emotions. In this study, the use of social media is one factor among many, and it is only one factor among other contributors,"" co-author Dr. Steven C. Davis, chairman and co-director of the Center on Health Disparities and Health Disparities Research, said in the statement.

While the Trump administration did not express support for the decision, it did not formally criticize it: ""The United States views with grave concern any effort to conclude an agreement that jeopardizes the possibility of a contiguous, viable and sustainable Palestinian state with internationally recognized borders, including the establishment of a viable Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital,"" the statement read.

The White House statement referred to two U.N. Security Council resolutions that passed on November 29 regarding settlements. Resolution 2334 demanded ""immediate and full freeze on all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem."" It also called on Israel ""to immediately cease all such activities."" The Trump administration has not yet announced its position on the two resolutions.

Witnesses said the woman, who was wearing pyjamas, was standing on her front lawn when the dog ""popped up off her driveway"".

Police, paramedics and the dog owner have not been able to find the other victim.

The justices accepted a petition from Gloucester County, Virginia, ruling that the school board was not required to comply with a lower court's order that transgender student Gavin Grimm should be allowed to use the boys' bathroom.
