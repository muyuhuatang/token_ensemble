"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. ""In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,"" he said.

Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its EU budget authority, the European Investment Bank, to boost green investment abroad.

The IGB's lending of funds to projects in the Middle East, and to renewable technologies, was expected to reach an aggregate of roughly €14bn this year, including loans to the renewable energy projects of Abu Dhabi's Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, he said.

But at the same time, Germany was looking to diversify sources of financing for its green energy projects as the crisis in Ukraine showed that it was still vital to support renewables, he said.

""We must learn from that experience. We need to see if we can expand the scope of the European Investment Bank towards long-term financing, rather than into short-term measures, which usually cause delays,"" Carney said.

In one of the most important policy talks of the year, the government revealed plans in Tuesday's Budget to ban private vehicles from London's tube network by 2023. It also said it was considering plans to get cars off the city's road and replace them with buses instead by 2025, which would cost thousands of jobs and affect the economy of central London - not to mention the air pollution to be removed.

Now new research suggests that the government's commitment was no bluff.

It concluded that banning private vehicles from London's Tube network would save 1,935 lives, cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2,895 tonnes a year and result in the loss of 16,000 hours of lost work per year.

Aviation experts say the case of Mr MacLellan's collision is an excellent example of how drones could hinder safety. Experts have warned that pilots should not use drones for takeoff and landing, particularly when flying near populated areas. They also advise against flying in restricted airspace, where pilots should not be able to control flying.

In the New Zealand case, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority declined to comment on the individual case but said that due to the high risk from drones, ""aircraft pilots would not allow them on board"".

In contrast, United States Federal Aviation Authority spokesman Ian Gregor said that drone operators should be given special training in how to fly them safely. He said that the FAA also has rules covering other kinds of aircraft.

The pair died in March 2014, after the two were left in a lift. According to Mr Eeson's defence, the pair had fallen ill without a trace of panic and had only been told the lift was broken at the station's car park.

After they woke up the next morning, they were found badly beaten in the lift. Mr Eeson faces life in prison if convicted.

Hrid also called upon the lawmakers to stop being manipulated by the ""bastards"" behind the draft law.

Graham took the blow on the stomach and the guy came down with a terrible coughing fit. Graham, by this time in his stride, calmly returned to his bar stool, pulled the bar stool out from under him and sat down.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

South Korea's Constitutional Court ordered Ms Choi, 63, be investigated on charges of abuse of power, but she denies any wrongdoing.

Ms Park has also been charged over her relationship with Ms Choi after a new judge overseeing the corruption case revealed that three former presidential aides - Ms Park's former chief secretary, who has also been accused of collusion with Ms Choi, and another political ally, Choi Soon-sil - also provided gifts to Ms Choi.

By 2020, the number of refugees will have risen to 56 million - that's 16 of the world's 30 top-grossing economies.

It's important to understand that, just because a country is rich, for Oxfam and the government of Australia to see it as a poor country with little influence is wrong. To the contrary, Australia is a major player in the global economic growth and development system. This report, written by Oxfam's Australian and Japanese general secretaries, explains who the refugees actually are.

Whiting added some of the controversial incidents last year related to this issue would potentially be treated differently were similar ones to occur in 2017.

But in a first, it was issued on Monday instead of last week after the Belgian newspaper Le Soir found evidence of the practice at the Barcelona track.

It happened when another driver and a marshal were talking about a crash involving Verstappen on Sunday and asked the marshal: ""Did Max use his brakes?""

Verstappen said yes, the marshal replied, but Verstappen's car was fitted with sensors which registered whether he had applied the brakes or not.

That is likely to have allowed Red Bull to use that information to assess the driver, either during or after a crash.

Le Soir found that a marshal had written that Verstappen's car had been fitted with the sensor as a ""cost saving measure"".

A series of mathematical formulas can help explain the creation of the universe, from the Big Bang to the laws of physics.

The maths behind them was discovered after an international team of scientists used a computer to test what happened to the energy of the universe at various points in time.

The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, looked at three dimensions of the space-time fabric.

For each axis, there is a 'big bang' for which we can calculate the temperature and density conditions as they changed.

A second dimension is the expansion of space-time over time.

These include an analysis of all the suicides in Britain between 1999 and 2002 in which an individual was taking an antidepressant and the year before, and comparing such individuals with people who did not take an antidepressant, which yielded an increased risk of suicide of nearly 20 percent for those who took the antidepressants.

However, for most people, the risk of becoming depressed is quite low, and the benefits of antidepressant treatment, like preventing suicidal thoughts, are high.

Its skipper, John McFall said the boat, named the Daring, would have needed to be anchored more than 100 metres in front of the propeller to prevent the engine from grinding against the back of the craft. However, in order for the vessel to be safe the ship's rudder had to be raised to keep it on its course and prevent it from being turned off. Despite this, the boat came within 300 metres of the submarine.

According to reports, McFall feared for his life and decided to dive to the bottom to retrieve the rudder, only to realise the boat was too damaged to pull himself on board. The decision to stay on board had to stand to ensure the vessel was undamaged and that McFall was unhurt if the craft sank.

The evidence came out as a result of a long struggle by Sinn Féin and the SDLP on both an Irish Prison Service inquiry into abuses in Northern Ireland's jails, and an appeal by Massey's family against a jury verdict for murder.

The trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that the scheme could not go ahead while the council's planning policy against ""development for economic benefit"" on the site was in place.

The club was advised by the development firm to ask in a letter to the council last April: ""Why is this scheme not compatible [with the policy]?""

The theft is the largest in a series of high-profile robberies in Cannes, which is famous for its annual film festival. The Carlton Hotel is where Alfred Hitchcock filmed To Catch A Thief - his 1955 film about a jewel thief operating in the French Riviera. During the latest theft, an exhibition of diamonds by the jeweller Leviev was being held in the lobby of the hotel. Local media said the robber made off with the jewels in a briefcase.

Combined with other plant techniques, the team created drops that grew larger as temperatures increased.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has ruled he was lawfully killed by police.

The two-week trial in the Old Bailey started last month. The CPS is expected to make its announcement shortly after the jury returns on February 2.

A CPS spokesman added: ""We have no further comment to make.""

The trial is the second by the IPCC in Northern, and the first in England and Wales, and is the culmination of two investigations into deaths of unarmed, black people by police.

The first, launched in March 2011, found the case officers were justified in using lethal force on Mr Grainger, because he had been assaulting an officer with the intention of causing injury.

The following year an independent inquiry found the IPCC was ""not sufficiently transparent"" about the process and how it reached its conclusions.

The allegations against him stem from the government's 2012 decision not to renew state contracts related to Sao Paulo's World Cup stadium.

The investigation was prompted after Odebrecht pleaded guilty to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to politicians, public officials and their relatives and business associates around the world.

Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media.

This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts.

Evidence is increasingly supporting","Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say.

""People who use social media at night are more likely to be depressed, more likely to seek the help of their medical profession, more likely to binge drink — and more likely to use illegal drugs,"" the researchers wrote in their findings.

The study is the first to show increased negative emotions in night users compared with those who wake up.

The findings indicate that not all night users experience increased negative emotions.

""This is very important because night activity is only one of many factors that contribute to negative emotions. In this study, the use of social media is one factor among many, and it is only one factor among other contributors,"" co-author Dr. Steven C. Davis, chairman and co-director of the Center on Health Disparities and Health Disparities Research, said in the statement.

","Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media , and who use it at night , were more likely to feel depressed and anxious , they say . For instance , studies show that using Snapchat affects how many times people think about suicide . This in turn impacts on their mental stability. Others say the same is true of Facebook and Twitter . How many times have you thought “ I shouldn ’ t have shared that – it ’ s too personal ” ? So if you ever find yourself thinking your personal problems are too big for you to handle , you do not need to let them invade your online life . Simply take a break from social media , and make a conscious effort to get out doors and meet up with friends face to face . You ’ ll be amazed how good it feels , not just on your mental health , but also your social life . < /s > < /s >",7.64

""Chantal Cisse has passed away after a sudden illness on Saturday April 13 at 18:12 hrs. she passed away at the hospital,"" the statement read.

Cisse has represented Gabon at international level since 2003.

Cisse has won four African Cups of Nations titles and the FIFA Club World Cup and also was at the helm with Gabon at the 2014 African Nations Championships in Equatorial Guinea.","The 35-year-old collapsed during a training session with his Gabonese club FC 105 Libreville .

"The case concerns a Virginia public school district trying to prevent a female-born 17-year-old transgender student from using the boys' bathroom. The justices are expected to rule on the case before the end of June. The high court is one justice short after the death of Antonin Scalia, which could lead to a 4-4 decision. Schools districts nationwide remain conflicted on whether to require transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with the sex listed on their birth certificates. The justices accepted a petition from Gloucester County, Virginia, ruling that the school board was not required to comply with a lower court's order that transgender student Gavin Grimm should be allowed to use the boys' bathroom. Gavin, a student who was born female but identifies as male, came out as a transgender boy during his freshman year of high school. He sued the school board, arguing that they discriminated against him and its bathroom policy violated his civil rights. The US Court","The case concerns a Virginia public school district trying to prevent a female-born 17-year-old transgender student from using the boys' bathroom. The parents of the student are suing, alleging that the student is not sufficiently distressed during such bathroom usage to justify them. The school district says that if that were the case, the student would not be allowed to use the bathroom at all. The court will determine whether a student has the right to use a restroom consistent with their gender identity.

Texas and Oklahoma both have laws on the books that bar transgender people from using public restrooms that don't correspond to their birth gender. Transgender people are barred from using public restrooms using ""alternative facilities"" that do not match their gender at birth. But courts have been split on whether requiring transgender people to use bathrooms that do not exactly correspond to their anatomy is a violation of the constitutional rights of people to privacy and bodily privacy.","The case concerns a Virginia public school district trying to prevent a female-born 17-year-old transgender student from using the boys ' bathroom .

If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone.

She and the government's chief economist, Udo Steffen, agree that one way to improve labour supply would be to relax labour-market rules, which are more onerous for the jobless than for the job-holding populace.

The artist behind the artwork said she was inspired to create It's Time after visiting Glastonbury, which took place this weekend, where she ""saw people united"".

Anthony McIntyre was one of the main researchers in the project. A subpoena was served on the college at the weekend demanding access to interviews about his IRA activities. The college says it will file a motion to quash the subpoena. McIntyre's legal team in Belfast also plan to lodge papers in the High Court challenging the legality of a decision by the PPS to use an international treaty to seek assistance from the US authorities. The subpoena was served on the college by a lawyer acting on behalf of the British government.

Both he and Dr Noy had refused to give information as to the whereabouts of the information.

He has already been suspended. I don't think they are going to give up so easily.

It is possible that the Irish government is playing a big part in this too.

At the weekend, Minister Mary Mitchell O'Connor was quoted in a story saying she was not aware of a case where a politician had lied to a court.

Now we have an inquiry into this and as I know from visiting Irish diasporan organisations and politicians, the problem is deep rooted and deep rooted. Whether they know about it or not.

But why would a politician lie? Why would she give up the truth if it was so important to her supporters?

"Denis Donaldson was murdered in County Donegal in April 2006, months after being exposed as an agent who worked for the police and MI5 for 20 years. He was once a key figure in Sinn Féin's rise in Northern Ireland politics. The coroner adjourned the inquest until a separate criminal investigation is concluded. The inquest has previously been adjourned at least 19 times. Gardai Superintendent (Supt) Michael Finan told the coroner on Wednesday that a ""continuing, active, significant investigation"" was ongoing. He said an individual who had already appeared before the courts was due back in the Special Criminal Court in October and three arrests had been made in the last four months.

The murder of Donaldson comes amid renewed concern over the level of undercover police officers operating in Northern Ireland.

A total of 31 police officers were jailed for acts of misconduct, including four undercover officers whose covert work during the Good Friday talks led to widespread public concern during the unrest leading to the Good Friday Agreement.

The revelations come after the DUP's justice spokesman, Mark Durkan, asked the Attorney General to investigate allegations some gardaí may have been involved in any illegal activity.

Garda sources have said two alleged officers and a sergeant under the direction of Sgt Maurice McCabe in 2009 took part in an MI5 undercover operation.

The allegations have not been proven and, if substantiated, they could bring criminal convictions.","Denis Donaldson was murdered in County Donegal in April 2006 , months after being exposed as an agent who worked for the police and MI5 for 20 years .

"The prime minister raised the subject during talks with US President Barack Obama at the White House. Critics of existing rules say they make the extradition of UK nationals easier as the US authorities have to produce less evidence to support their case. But a senior judge reviewing it in 2011 found it was fair to British citizens. The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Cameron had raised the issue about how extradition rules are operating in practice during two hours of talks at the White House on Wednesday. The prime minister is in the middle on a three-day official visit to the United States. Concerns have been raised about the 2003 US-UK extradition treaty following controversial cases involving British citizens such as Christopher Tappin and Gary McKinnon. Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights are among those who have urged the government to renegotiate the treaty, saying","The prime minister raised the subject during talks with US President Barack Obama at the White House. Critics of existing rules say they make the extradition of UK nationals nearly impossible.

The latest figures released show that 4,000 EU nationals are being detained in Britain on terrorism-related charges, a three-fold increase on the 3,900 last year.

They include British national Bilal Abdulla, 27, from Cardiff, who admitted membership of ISIL and other terror groups in court in the US.

Former Labour attorney general Dominic Grieve questioned the government's lack of commitment towards tackling the issue.

He told the Guardian: ""They don't have to make any sacrifices now to meet the new challenge of having thousands of terrorists, criminals and those convicted of violent offences on their doorstep.""

But the Home Office says that it is a ""vital"" part of their threat assessments, and is working with their international partners to address the issue.
