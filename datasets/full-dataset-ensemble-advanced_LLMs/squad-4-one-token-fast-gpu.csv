"In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: ""Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)"". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained.

The occasion also contained an international conference on Slavic literature in France. During the conference there were many discussions on the ways in which the Serbian and Croatian literary traditions could serve as a bridge for the European literary project. The most significant among them was the conference held on 14-15th January 1959, in Paris between Srdja Trifunovic, the literary critic and leader of the Slovene Renaissance, and Jadranka Lajeva (later president-designate of the Council of Europe).

Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force.

"An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in.

"Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators.

In 1765, the great French historian Michel de Montaigne published the essay The Spirit of Revolution, which was a response to Thomas Paine's Common Sense that was published in 1776. In the 1780s, the term revolution (which de Montaigne used also) was associated with the French Revolution. Its modern use occurred in the late 1800s when anti-imperialist ideas took hold.

In it, the author reveals that the term ""revolution"" has been used in America in a variety of ways and is not always meant in the same sense today.

"Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring.

This suggests that everything that separates us from","Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the immune system (Jasanoff, 1975), and this system has an important impact on many diseases of the brain.

This study highlights the importance of emotion and social interaction in stress responses. Emotions are fundamental to biological processes and therefore may influence stress responses. In this context, several of the studies, including stress responses and inflammation in social interactions, showed that these effects were specific to socially stressful situations. It is likely that similar results occur in other types of stress response, such as those in the face of the financial crisis. Thus, the idea of emotional regulation and the effects of social interactions on stress response and inflammation might be modified.

To our knowledge, most of the studies investigating acute social stress responses have studied the stress response after a few days or weeks. Many of the studies showed an association between acute social stress","Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology , particularly with the stress systems .

They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population.

Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated ""favoured races"" as ""perfected races"", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack.

The best translation of the book ever was done by a Frenchman, M. De l'Amiral, who began English translations in the years after Darwin's death.

In addition to their disagreements in methodology and content, the two German Idealists disagreed in the nature of their ethical philosophy.

A royal commission was established to monitor the activities of foreign merchants (1556) and by the end of the century French interests in the Netherlands had shrunk to a minimum (1568), even as French power spread into the lowlands of Europe (1627).

The most important of these changes was the development of the French empire from the 16th to the 19th century, and the end of the Renaissance. The reign of Charles VI (1610–14), which saw a series of civil wars and major rebellions, culminated in an unprecedented defeat by the forces of the Holy Roman Empire in 1648.

"Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem.

As we move past adolescence and continue on into our adult years, identity development becomes even more important. We all strive to find what we are, and for most of us this quest will take many trips to the identity doctor and then a journey through numerous phases of denial.

You might have even been caught in a phase of denial of your sexual orientation.

Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen.

It is not known exactly how the injection is performed, but when one injects the epinephrine it is absorbed into the blood as normal. However, when the epinephrine is taken out of the body it is converted into a powerful vasoconstrictor. This is caused by the increased presence of ""pH"" ions. If it is not contained within the body, it would be stored as excess calcium within the arteries due to the increase in calcium.

"Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin.

In most Jewish populations, these founder events probably represent, at best, a very small subset of all the Jews.

This is somewhat less than the age of the first Jewish men from sub-Saharan Africa, so the evidence does not support the picture of a new migration from Africa to Europe and back.

"Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets.

Many vertebrates, such as salamanders, lagomorphs - a group of extinct mammals - have no uric acids. Instead their high uric acid content is taken up in a form similar to urea, used to produce urea which then converts to urochromes and urea-glucuronide. So a carnivore (or other obligate carnivore, since that usually relies on blood to survive) will always have a high concentration of urea-based proteins even if it has no uric acid.


In birds, the most common uric acid is chystrale, which is found in about 80 and 75 percent of the birds tested. The other uric acid is uric acid, which is made by birds at an even higher concentration.

"Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany. Stalin immediately directed Molotov to ""purge the ministry of Jews."" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany.

"When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself.

"Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the ladder match. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include – but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize).

Some other formats of game play may also involve a ladder match, typically based on the order of draw of the players.

Some games also have a tiebreaker. Usually, a combination of tiebreakers are used, with players going back to the top of the ladder in the final and deciding game on how well they have done in the tiebreakers they have used, with the final one being the tiebreaker game.

Somewhere between the tiebreaker game and the main tournament is the ""main event"". During this tournament, various match formats may be used.

"By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole.

The most likely explanation for the Mac's slow sales and disappointing results was the strong demand for Windows laptops among consumers. In fact, for a limited number of users, OS X and Mac laptop sales have exceeded Windows laptop sales, which suggest Apple didn't just lose market share, but lost Mac laptops too.

Sound was stored in the sound device. Audio signals were transmitted directly to the sound device and then encoded into a standard bit stream, which could then be decoded at the sound device. The signal could be stored on a magnetic disk or recorded on to a phonograph disc.

Because of the way these machines stored sound, some sources such as a tape may be better than others. For example, a phonograph may sound better than vinyl on some types of recordings. Also, a tape will retain more information than any other medium. For example, the sounds from many recordings might require many times more information than music available in a compact disc.

"From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as ""put-ons"". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons.","From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and calculate the motion of all the world's particles according to a complex mathematical formula. At first, Feynman never succeeded in the precise calculations he needed to prove his theorem to the satisfaction of his advisor, who found that they needed quite a lot of work. Then, in 1953, Feynman had an extraordinary realization: that he could solve this problem as completely as possible while in the midst of doing experiments—because of his mathematical ideas about interactions and field theory.

Fearing the public reaction of those not willing to believe him at first, despite his excellent mathematical calculations, Feynman turned to the world to try and convince them. He wrote one paper for the physics journal Nature before he was accepted to graduate school. He published his work, in 1958, in two publications: ""On the Characteristics of the Universe,","From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime , Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the fields generated by their interaction.

"In late 1203, John attempted to relieve Château Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly.

John's capture of Château Gaillard was widely reported in the English countryside.

"In 2013, however, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B.

Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins.

In this paper, Richards et al. note that some groups that now seem to have a substantial number of African origins, have a very small Middle Eastern ancestry. Some groups, including many of the Ashkenazim, appear to have undergone a considerable number of admixture events with neighboring Arab tribes, but this should not result in a genetic bottleneck as a result of such long-distance admixture.

While a person's self-concept is important in defining one's identity it is not the only factor. Many times people define their identity by comparing themselves to other people in their lives. Some research has shown that identity formation is influenced by children's attitudes from the time they're children where they are given a new label. If children are given a new label then they will define themselves as being better and better because of that label. This allows their mind to be used to make sense of the world for them. However, other research studies show that identity is the result of a person's beliefs toward themselves and others.

Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke","On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by Walter Scott. In the following year, the Tories returned for a second term. On 27 March 1798, Burke retired from public life. On 30 June 1798, he died at the young age of 46.

The man who gave the Tories such a strong foothold in Scotland from 1772 to 1785 was the Earl of Douglas. As Lord Lieutenant of Scotland he was at loggerheads with George III's court. He was a man who had fought many battles; for instance in the Battle of Crécy, where the Scots were routed at the cost of one of their finest regiments. He had survived the massacre of the North-West Highland regiments when he had been on campaign in Poland against Napoleon III. He was a man of great military ability. He had been raised to the peerage just prior to the battle","On 20 June 1794 , Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat , being replaced on  1 5 Sep.

The Blore Brewery was an early proponent of modern industrial beer technology, as well as a major industrial innovator, with most of its breweries under the Blore brand, making Blore beer the first British beer brewed exclusively in the United Kingdom. The company also sponsored the Olympic Games from 1900 to 1908 and opened an exhibition hall at Greenwich Park for tourists and members of the public to tour.

The brewery produced a total of 55 million pints per year, in part due to the success of its 'Wholly Beer' brand and the creation of the 'Blommer' which replaced the old 'Burl' in 1908.

The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war.

Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks.

Many houses and commercial centres were heavily","On 13 March, the upper Clyde port of Clydebank near Glasgow was bombed. All but seven of its 12,000 houses were damaged. Many of the civilians suffered from acute respiratory symptoms, but no deaths or injuries occurred. A similar attack on another of the Clyde ports on 14 May killed 18 people in a munitions factory in Orkney. The munitions had been made at a new manufacture, at Lalla, just outside Argyll (Argyll and Bute) in Scotland. Lalla was just four miles away from the factory. There were many similarities between these attacks. Both occurred shortly after the United States had declared that it was going to start a war to overthrow the government of the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. In their first days of fighting they were both blamed (falsely) on Gaddafi's government. There also were striking similarities in the timing of the attacks. On both dates – days between the Easter break and the weekend – the American and Nato governments were claiming","On 13 March , the upper Clyde port of Clydebank near Glasgow was bombed .

"By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip. The invasion of Canada was a debacle, though concurrent wars with Native Americans on the western front (Tecumseh's War and the Creek War) were more successful. After defeating Napoleon in 1814, Britain sent large veteran","By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with the United States, United States warships bombarded British ships, captured over 400 British ships and landed a force of over 15,000 soldiers in Canada. However, these military interventions in the affairs of its neighbors were not a sufficient response to the threat posed by Britain and France. The real threat to the American economy was the war-drenched American economy itself which relied on a series of massive export trade deficits to keep the war-starved country solvent. The United States finally won its War for Independence, but only after decades of military spending and foreign trade embargoes, a military that would become largely unnecessary as a result of a series of technological advances.

There were other times in which the United States fought major wars that left it with a lasting impact, most notably the Civil War, but also World Wars I and II.

John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar.

"Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, ""How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?"" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, ""How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?"" Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they have seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that","Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and complex. Memory is not static; it is continuously stored in our brain. The act of remembering, in the same way the act of making a record is, is an ongoing process of generating new, fresh memory and replaying it from one place to another in time-space so as to obtain a memory of something that occurred later. Memory, it should be emphasized, differs from ordinary memory, which is just remembering what you have been told, in the sense that'memory' refers to memories which represent actual events which occurred to the person at the time and which have not been forgotten by him, in the sense of being remembered only in part.

'Memory', in this sense, is not something that does not die without leaving any trace behind. In particular, there is evidence that new synaptic connections are formed in the hippocampus after time","Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment , it is not the case .

"Following the fall of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu uprising against the Jin dynasty (265–420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181–234), a chancellor of the state of Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, closed village Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name ""Zhuge"".

"A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science,","A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., emotional violence), individual characteristics (e.g., depression), and interpersonal patterns (e.g., interpersonal problems), in which the first two dimensions represent individual behavioral constructs and the interpersonal pattern dimensions are seen as defining personal behavior. In a similar vein, the emotions and disorders theory proposes that there are emotions and disorders which result from the complex interconnections among the three dimensions of emotions described thus far. Although not necessarily exclusive, there is growing evidence in the literature to suggest that, in some cases, only one of the dimensions of emotions is considered important within the field.

This interdependence of individual behavioral constructs that can coactivate or interact with each other has been found to hold true for mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders.

"The United States has become essentially a two-party system.

The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections.

In one letter Wallace mentions the possibility of spontaneous mutation.

The natural selection theory proposed by Darwin was based on both ""junk"" and ""workable"" concepts, i.e., ""junk"" meaning ""not biologically significant or useful, i.e., non-functional but useful,"" whereas ""workable"" means ""useful.""

For example, menarche (the first menstrual period of a female), or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures.

Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur.

"Hidalgo is hailed as the Father of the Nation even though it was Agustin de Iturbide and not Hidalgo who achieved Mexican Independence in 1821.

"Although the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians, it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary ""prepurified"" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was ""purified"" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally ""holier than all 'Men' born of woman"" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero.

"The political structure of Western Europe changed with the end of the united Roman Empire. Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as ""invasions"", they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire. Such movements were aided by the refusal of the western Roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration. The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d. 408), Aspar (d. 471), Ricimer (d. 472), or Gundobad (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman background. When the line of western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in","The political structure of Western Europe changed with the end of the united Roman Empire.

This period saw further transformations in the structure of the states themselves.

Because bacteria and viruses can be cultured in a wide variety of growth conditions, including low concentration media, medium that is sterile and medium that is supplemented with growth aids, they can be placed in a variety of settings to mimic the types of settings in which they might exist.

In addition to determining the presence/absence of various infectious agents, a culture of an infectious agent may also determine information regarding the host factors that are present in the host. For example, a bacterial strain of Serratia marcescens grown in a microbiological","Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease .

What is Boot Camp for?

To fully understand the reasoning behind not supporting Macs with a PowerPC processor, we need to look into the specifics of how each architecture is built. It turns out that the PowerPC architecture was not originally intended to be a single architecture. On the surface, the instruction set consists of two parts:

"While medieval pageants and festivals such as Corpus Christi were church-sanctioned, Carnival was also a manifestation of medieval folk culture. Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian–Alemannic Fastnacht. However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the resurrection of Jesus, followed by a liminal period and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the lunar calendar.

Many local people used Carnival as a chance to entertain their neighbors and friends with displays of merriment, song, and dance. The most famous Carnival of the Middle Ages was that which was held at Saint-Germain-des-Prés on March 9-12.

The feast fell in late spring as spring gave way naturally to summer, and, with the changing temperatures, became the most important period in France's year. It represented the renewal of life and the beginning of winter. The festivities for the 12th of March included street and tavern markets, food courts, games, and theatrical performances. In the countryside, peasants threw large parties to celebrate.

"Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559.

Under the terms of his agreement with Charles IX, the elector of Hainault, and in order to placate the other Protestant princes, Calvin was allowed to retain many of his most eminent scholars while all the other Protestants were forced to pay tribute. One such outstanding scholar was the historian Jacques de Thou, who wrote the famous work, the ""History of the French Reformation"" (1631-36). This book, an outstanding work, was first translated into Latin in 1638 by the Dominican Father Francois Dezsel.

"Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values.

Children enter maturity between the ages of 10 and 15. They develop and increase in physical strength and begin to develop social maturity. During this time the child must learn life lessons that provide them with the tools for self-fulfillment. These lessons are best learned through observation of other children and their parents, and by playing the role that is given to the child.

"Homer refers to the ""Hellenes"" (/ˈhɛliːnz/) as a relatively small tribe settled in Thessalic Phthia, with its warriors under the command of Achilleus. The Parian Chronicle says that Phthia was the homeland of the Hellenes and that this name was given to those previously called Greeks (Γραικοί). In Greek mythology, Hellen, the patriarch of Hellenes, was son of Pyrrha and Deucalion, who ruled around Phthia, the only survivors after the great deluge. It seems that the myth was invented when the Greek tribes started to separate from each other in certain areas of Greece and it indicates their common origin.

The Homeric Mycenaeans included descendants of the Aetolians, who were in turn the descendants of the Cretans. The Etruscans and Messapians were a later settlers on the Greek mainland after the Mycenaeans. The original Athenians appear to have originated in the mainland.

Greek History

The Ephors, or ""Eleanthians"", were the first to colonize Greece. The Ephors were able to settle because their homeland, Eretria, was relatively free from enemies. From Homer the Greeks had also learned that their Ephor, or ""Elean"", enemies were in fact the Pelasgi, descended from the Aesir.

"Initially, the Turkish Cypriots favoured the continuation of the British rule. However, they were alarmed by the Greek Cypriot calls for enosis as they saw the union of Crete with Greece, which led to the exodus of Cretan Turks, as a precedent to be avoided, and they took a pro-partition stance in response to the militant activity of EOKA. The Turkish Cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to self-determination from Greek Cypriots. Meanwhile, in the 1950s, Turkish leader Menderes considered Cyprus an ""extension of Anatolia"", rejected the partition of Cyprus along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to Turkey. Nationalistic slogans centred on the idea that ""Cyprus is Turkish"" and the ruling party declared Cyprus to be a part of the Turkish homeland that was vital to its","Initially, the Turkish Cypriots favoured the continuation of the British rule. However, they were alarmed by the Greek Cypriot calls for enosis, and by the strong Greek nationalist movements, which threatened to drive the Turks out from their homes. Hence, they accepted the British proposal in early 1920. To make sure that the Cypriot administration was friendly towards the British, George IV agreed to pay the island of Rhodes up to a certain sum. This sum was eventually paid by Great Britain, and was to be distributed out proportion to the number of Greeks who migrated to Cyprus. But this was only half done, for by this time the Cypriots had their own political organisation called the Ekklesi. This was headed by the Greek-speaking nationalist Nikaia Anastasiadou.

"The European concept of ""race"", along with many of the ideas now associated with the term, arose at the time of the scientific revolution, which introduced and privileged the study of natural kinds, and the age of European imperialism and colonization which established political relations between Europeans and peoples with distinct cultural and political traditions. As Europeans encountered people from different parts of the world, they speculated about the physical, social, and cultural differences among various human groups. The rise of the Atlantic slave trade, which gradually displaced an earlier trade in slaves from throughout the world, created a further incentive to categorize human groups in order to justify the subordination of African slaves. Drawing on Classical sources and upon their own internal interactions — for example, the hostility between the English and Irish powerfully influenced early European thinking about the differences","The European concept of ""race"", along with many of the ideas now associated with the term, arose at the time of the scientific revolution, which introduced the notion of natural selection - the idea that traits are inherited by descent. As with many cultural theories, the theory was later discredited, particularly in the 20th century, when evolutionary theory replaced it.

However, many modern-day Americans think of race as hereditary, with specific genetic differences between different races. People have been fascinated by claims that whites have evolved white skin through the process of selective breeding, while East Asians often have dark skin due to the fact that they had darker skin in their original homeland. Recent research has also shown that our DNA could be viewed as a mixture of European and African DNA, with many areas of the genome potentially influenced by both.","The European concept of `` race '' , along with many of the ideas now associated with the term , arose at the time of the scientific revolution , which took place in late medieval and early modern Europe. During this same period, the term used in Latin to describe race became the Latin word `` race ''.   This concept, along with other concepts of the time, was associated with the concept of `` difference `` that we have inherited from this period. This was later associated with the concept of `` inequality `` that we have inherited from this era.",7.2
"The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), for supremacy in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite ""in the near future"".

"Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the ""purification"" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of ""purification"" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as ""prokathartheisa (prepurified)."" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of","Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of antiquity, since most of them held that the body of Mary, or the body of the infant Jesus (although she could be conceived in several ways), was entirely and forever exempt from all stain or defect of sin. It was in this way that they believed that she alone was pure from the seed of Adam. In the earliest Christian documents, it is assumed that Mary was assumed into the heavenly realm by Jesus (Matt. 1:23, John 1:30).

As Jerome puts it, ""It would be very strange if that one were also God, since He had, after the divine manner, begotten a son."")

All lines must carry the same tank capacity at all times. All the lines must be operated in a coordinated manner to ensure the right amount of oil is being delivered for the best possible quality.

It is particularly important that the pipelines from the pipeline to the storage tanks are kept in phase as a result of their design. It is believed that the best place for the pumps for pumping at least 4 and up to 24 000 gallons of oil is at a designated location for the line feeders in order to assure that they are at the right temperature according to the feeder station they are connected to.

"The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends.

Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period.

The first Protestant church did not have to adhere to the strict separation of church and state that characterized church-state relations in pre-modern Europe. In fact, Protestant churches maintained some official autonomy in their handling of local affairs.

The papacy did not welcome this new status quo. At least one Protestant preacher, Peter Abel","Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom .

"Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent’s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment.

However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter.

Under the Emperor Hidetsugu I we saw a significant reduction in population with many people fleeing to various parts of China but overall the Empire had been maintained and even improved by the Tokugawa as they expanded their domains from the northern part of Japan to as far as Korea. Even after the Shōgun became the emperor of China in 1614, the Tokugawa continued to rule Japan until 1854 when the last Tokugawa Shōgun, Otsu Tokimune, fled China back to Japan and his heir, the future Tokugawa Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, was established.

"Chapter XI deals with evidence from biogeography, starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences alone; South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals. The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: ""On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even","Chapter XI deals with evidence from biogeography, starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences. Instead, the study of geography shows that, like a fingerprint, the flora and fauna of a region can be predicted for a range of environmental conditions due to the effect of topography and the climate on plant and animal populations. For example, in the New World tropics, most mammal species live in dense forests, with few plants and a low biodiversity. Many areas in North America have similar topographical conditions, but tropical rodents are found nowhere, while carnivores are found throughout the American south.

Cultural influences also alter ecosystems. As the study of the ecology of the human environment has grown, so have new environmental pressures and conflicts. A few studies have focused on cultural processes to understand changes in ecosystems. To some, changing local laws in an area tend to shift local fauna and flora.

This enhances the brain’s abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation.

It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep.

This form of learning is important for learning new tasks, because we accumulate new information over time and remember little of what we've learned.

"Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the ""non-breeding"" plumage, or—in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology—""basic"" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as ""alternate"" plumages. Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap.","Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the ""non-breeding plumage"".

The feathers on the head and flanks, the talons and the beak (gizzard) are all considered part of the pre-breeding plumage and so must be removed, and sometimes a part of a bird that has moulted must be preserved to protect itself from predation.

It is thought that after breeding the sexes develop different plumage, because in early development, all other parts of the bird are covered with the same feather cells.

However, not all parts of the plumage are equally important in survival. The beak is thought to be one of the most important parts in pre-breeding plumage because of the importance of a beak to feeding, and to helping a bird keep a balance in balance between itself and the environment.

Most of these are oxidizers (i.e., acceptors of electrons) and some react very strongly. For the continued normal cellular maintenance, growth, and division, these free radicals must be sufficiently neutralized by antioxidant compounds. Recently, some researchers suggested an interesting theory of evolution of dietary antioxidants. Some are produced by the human body with adequate precursors (glutathione, Vitamin C), and those the body cannot produce may only be obtained in the diet via direct sources (Vitamin C in humans, Vitamin A, Vitamin K) or produced by the body from other compounds (Beta-carotene converted to Vitamin A by the body, Vitamin D synthesized from cholesterol by sunlight).

He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life.

Unfortunately, this kind of comparison is difficult to prove when it comes to Luther's writings.

In fact, some Church Fathers seem to make it very clear that they had no idea about Martin Luther's claims.

Their offer was to give equal rights to Hindus and Muslims within the existing British Indian empire, but for Curzon to get the Indians to accept this would require the British to give up control of India, which was seen as a threat to the interests of both the United Kingdom and Curzon himself.

But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement.

There is, however, no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer.

Physical states are no longer simply mental objects on which to pin our attention, but are rather something much deeper to be looked at in terms of what it means for a set of statements to be true or false. For instance, statements about the motion of a ship cannot be regarded as true or false because motion does not occur at all in the mind and no laws or relationships exist to connect a thought about motion with the actual motion of the ship itself.

In 1995 Madonna released her second solo album ""Like a Virgin, "" which became her first commercial success after ""Like a Prayer"" two years earlier. It was followed in 1996 by Live Aid and in the following years with some of her most successful commercial hits including a tribute to her late father, a song for the victims of the devastating earthquake in Indonesia and another for the victims of the 9/11 attack.

"As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort—the Theodosian Code—was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565).

The new Chinese dynasties developed the trade, maritime and economic industries and established a culture that was considered by historians as quite advanced in comparison with the previous. This era began in the 16th century with the establishment of the Ming Dynasty in the Tang Dynasty by an influential dynasty.

"Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials. They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas, once common in the Eastern Mediterranean. The most superb example can be found in the bath house of Hisham's Palace, Palestine which was made around 744. The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer (right side) and two deers peacefully grazing (left side). The panel probably represents good and bad governance. Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in Anjar, Lebanon.

The main Islamic design was the so-called qanati, that is, an array of rectilinear, straight-faced pillars that stood above the floor. This was followed by the tiling of the roof which began with rectilinear pillars and arches. After these initial features were covered by a mosaic, the ceiling would be covered by mosaics with floral and geometric motifs. On the roof and ceiling, a pattern of black and white tiles known as kafan was very common. On the floors, carpet decoration was highly prized and covered many of the rooms.

Other airports that are more than 100 years old have been named ""world's oldest"", but this is only because they opened before 1910.

It is also important to note that not all airlines are as fortunate as Air New Zealand and Qantas Australia where airports are being named after a long-established historical figure. Instead, a pilot may spend a significant amount of their time in flight waiting on a plane's departure time. This is often due to the frequent flight patterns of international aviation. Therefore, it is usually not wise to wait for the last possible minute to leave an airport for your next trip (this is why Qantas Australia's flight times are often out for longer than the airline's departure times).

"By August 1805, Napoleon had realized that the strategic situation had changed fundamentally. Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies, he decided to strike first and turned his army's sights from the English Channel to the Rhine. His basic objective was to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian allies could arrive. On 25 September, after great secrecy and feverish marching, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 260 km (160 mi). Austrian commander Karl Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Swabia. Napoleon swung his forces to the southeast and the Grande Armée performed an elaborate wheeling movement that outflanked the Austrian positions. The Ulm Maneuver completely surprised General Mack, who belatedly understood that his army had been cut off.

However, the French Army was spread too thin and was completely unprepared to win the land war; they simply retreated back to France. Napoleon went back to Europe to plan where to go next, and as his invasion time grew close, he received news of the British plan that Napoleon's main army was too spread out to effectively attack. He knew how he had failed in France and that he had no better option now; he made the decision to withdraw, and in August 1805, he sailed from France for the final time.

The most interesting thing about copper is the amount of copper it contains, and the fact that it is a metal with a fairly high melting point. Copper is a metal with an extremely large amount of energy stored in it, and the heat produced during the melting process can be used to create electricity. One of the reasons why the Romans used copper rather than iron for their weapons was the fact that copper held a higher thermal conductivity compared to iron. A high heat transfer coefficient allowed more heat to be carried away in one direction, making the metal the ideal choice for weapons.

Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.

"Different phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase , gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH","Different phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase occurs at about 7-9 hours after meal ingestion and consists of two stages: 1) food absorption, and 2) starch digestion.

The step 1 digestion reaction occurs between 16 hours and 24 hours after the intake of a meal in the cephalic phase ( ). The gastric acid reaction which begins about 4-6 hours after intake of a meal causes the breakdown of the first molecule of fiber in the gut and causes increased acid production that continues for 6-8 hours that then leads to the formation of bile which is then secreted into the colon which creates the absorptive capacity in the cephalic phase.

In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance. Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals.

While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force.

With these events in mind, Napoleon set out west for the Netherlands. He found a powerful stateless people that had survived for hundreds of years. In 1801 the Dutch were still fighting to survive, with some even using cannibalism. Although they were still in the process of changing their culture, the Dutch were also growing in numbers.

"In 1877, Thomas Edison invented the phonograph. Unlike the phonautograph, it was capable of both recording and reproducing sound. Despite the similarity of name, there is no documentary evidence that Edison's phonograph was based on Scott's phonautograph. Edison first tried recording sound on a wax-impregnated paper tape, with the idea of creating a ""telephone repeater"" analogous to the telegraph repeater he had been working on. Although the visible results made him confident that sound could be physically recorded and reproduced, his notes do not indicate that he actually reproduced sound before his first experiment in which he used tinfoil as a recording medium several months later. The tinfoil was wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder and a sound-vibrated stylus indented the tinfoil while the cylinder was rotated. The recording could be played back immediately.

Unlike the phonautograph, it was capable of both recording and reproducing sound. Despite the huge advances made throughout the century, the technology remained somewhat inefficient. The phonautographer was expensive, prone to malfunction and would require manual adjustments due to the poor quality of microphones and speaker combinations.

In 1927, J. P. Morgan and J. W. Carnegie had the idea to combine Edison's invention with other new technologies to create the first commercial computer. To create a sound recording of the same length as a human voice, a two-inch tape was mounted with a microphone to record audio with the voice. Using a reel-to-reel player, players would play a record using an electromagnet, which would rotate the tape along with the needle, resulting in recording sound. At this level of performance, the record could be sent across the radio frequency transmission spectrum by radio receivers, effectively creating a computer.

Napoleon's naval blockade against the United States resulted in the British and U.S. governments signing the Treaty of Ghent in October 1813 that ended the war and effectively ended both American presence in the Caribbean (having been forced to withdraw by Napoleon) and the maritime competition between France and Britain. In other words, this ended American independence in the Western Hemisphere as it once existed as a separate nation.

The treaty had the effect of ending American commercial rights in the entire North Atlantic, which also excluded the trade with the Caribbean, the West Indies Sea, the Persian Gulf and other territories.

"In biology, energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living organism. Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle of a biological organism. Energy is thus often said to be stored by cells in the structures of molecules of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars), lipids, and proteins, which release energy when reacted with oxygen in respiration. In human terms, the human equivalent (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500 kJ per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds' duration, a person can put","In biology, energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living organism. Within an organism it is responsible for growth and reproduction; it is involved in the regulation and elimination of toxins; it is responsible for the production and destruction of cell structures, including the cell nucleus [9]. Energy is a major determinant (pigment and enzyme, especially) of physical, chemical and biological processes. It represents the sum of all work done within the cell. Energy does not exist in empty space, as energy is required in the development of any biological substance [10]. It is the sum of all work performed within the cell.

The cellular organization of human beings involves the use of energy, because this organization requires the efficient and precise allocation of energy by the cell. The primary energy system is the phosphorescence process (phosphonophoresis).

Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places.

Eddie Condon explained: ""Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development."" The first two 12-inch recordings did not take advantage of the extra length: ""Carnegie Drag"" was 3:15; ""Carnegie Jump"", 2:41. But at the second session, on April 30, the two 12-inch recordings were longer: ""Embraceable You"" was 4:05; ""Serenade to a Shylock"", 4:32. Another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record. Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded ""Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean"", written by Irving and Jack Kaufman, as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo.

In a way, it's the classic recording for its time. Though Gabler uses a more technical approach than many sound men of the time, he still makes interesting use of the microphones and his own vocal stylings to create a story and, most importantly, capture the essence of the events taking place. There is a great deal of tension and mystery built into each recording. Here, he is in a small cottage; a very dangerous place to be at night. One minute he's out front; the next, up inside his own home. There's lots of very tense moments of negotiation, some shouting and much shouting. Most memorable is a shot of a woman screaming; an event that is of great importance to the characters in Gabler's stories.

"However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid. In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water.

For example, if the leaf is dropping from a tree or from the top of a house, then the leaf falling will cause the falling tree or the falling house to collapse (if its base is weak enough). And from this the result follows that the leaf fell from god which leads one to ask the question of ""why god would allow the leaf to fall from a non-god""? And if the leaves fall from something which is a tree than the question ""why on earth would the leaf fall from the top of something which is not an actual tree"" also arises, this leads in two interesting directions.

In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment.

"The deliberate or accidental hybridising of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown in recent times for economic purposes. The number of successful interspecific mammalian hybrids is relatively small, although it has come to be known that there is a significant number of naturally occurring hybrids between forms or regional varieties of a single species.[citation needed] These may form zones of gradation known as clines. Indeed, the distinction between some hitherto distinct species can become clouded once it can be shown that they may not only breed but produce fertile offspring. Some hybrid animals exhibit greater strength and resilience than either parent. This is known as hybrid vigor.

"The success of its football team made Notre Dame a household name. The success of Note Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied up around the team and listen to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America — Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students,","The success of its football team made Notre Dame a household name.

In the mid-to-late 1930s, note-saturated America absorbed the Irish and many other ethnic groups, including the German American, the Italian American, the Jewish American, the Greek American, the Scottish American, and the Asian American.

Because of the great growth of the Irish American community in the mid-1920s, the United States became a predominantly Catholic country. In 1928, 56.8% of the United States population identified as Catholic, of which the largest number lived in New York City (39%). Catholics accounted for 59.9% of all those living in metropolitan areas. Most Catholics lived in the Northeast, and the largest number resided in New York, New Jersey, and Philadelphia.

"Switzerland lies between latitudes 45° and 48° N, and longitudes 5° and 11° E. It contains three basic topographical areas: the Swiss Alps to the south, the Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau, and the Jura mountains on the west. The Alps are a high mountain range running across the central-south of the country, comprising about 60% of the country's total area. The majority of the Swiss population live in the Swiss Plateau. Among the high valleys of the Swiss Alps many glaciers are found, totalling an area of 1,063 square kilometres (410 sq mi). From these originate the headwaters of several major rivers, such as the Rhine, Inn, Ticino and Rhône, which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of Europe.

The Valsetzes and Ticino have a high mountainous surface, consisting of a mixture of limestone and glacial deposits, that has been shaped by glacial movement since the last Ice Age about 15 million years ago. It has a long coastline. The country is bordered by the Swiss Confederation, along with Liechtenstein, Canada and the United States. There are 17 different nationalities found inside Switzerland, most of which are not associated with specific ethnic groups.

"Boston has a continental climate with some maritime influence, and using the −3 °C (27 °F) coldest month (January) isotherm, the city lies within the transition zone from a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) to a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa), although the suburbs north and west of the city are significantly colder in winter and solidly fall under the latter categorization; the city lies at the transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b (most of the city) and 7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods). Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures.

To characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of the observed temperature variation, we use a spatial autocorrelation matrix, based on the time series derived from 30-m spatial mesh data (36), which represents the average temperature across a given swath of the city (see details in SI Text for information on obtaining temperature and precipitation records). At the scale of the city, the autocorrelation matrix has more than three times as many components as the nearest human-made gridded dataset, and in comparison, the autocorrelation of the raw data is only 0.4 °C, similar to the 1.2 °C autocorrelation of the data we use (see SI Text for details).

"As Muslim institutions of higher learning, the madrasa had the legal designation of waqf. In central and eastern Islamic lands, the view that the madrasa, as a charitable endowment, will remain under the control of the donor (and their descendent), resulted in a ""spurt"" of establishment of madaris in the 11th and 12th centuries. However, in Western Islamic lands, where the Maliki views prohibited donors from controlling their endowment, madaris were not as popular. Unlike the corporate designation of Western institutions of higher learning, the waqf designation seemed to have led to the exclusion of non-orthodox religious subjects such a philosophy and natural science from the curricula. The madrasa of al-Qarawīyīn, one of the two surviving madaris that predate the founding of the earliest medieval universities and are thus claimed to be the ""first universities"" by some authors, has acquired official university status as late as","As Muslim institutions of higher learning, the madrasa had the legal designation of waqf. In central and eastern Islamic lands, the view that clerics should focus exclusively on their religious duties carried much more weight - and with it, the legitimacy of the waqf system. From the 12th through the 14th centuries Islamic scholars developed this conception and its logical opposite, ""sharif."" Sharif also involved the acceptance of the jurisprudence of the caliph, and the establishment of institutions under the shari'a law. As we shall see below, only a small minority of Sunni theologians in the early 19th century called Shariah shari'a. The majority of those clerics (most of whom, like Muhammad Husayn ibn Munabbih, belonged to the Mu'tazilite stream of jurisprudence) argued that any government that established the authority of clerics over the public sphere would have violated the sacred law of shari'a.
