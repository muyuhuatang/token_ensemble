Now new research suggests that the government's commitment was no bluff.

It concluded that banning private vehicles from London's Tube network would save 1,935 lives, cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2,895 tonnes a year and result in the loss of 16,000 hours of lost work per year.

Experts have warned that pilots should not use drones for takeoff and landing, particularly when flying near populated areas. They also advise against flying in restricted airspace, where pilots should not be able to control flying.

In the New Zealand case, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority declined to comment on the individual case but said that due to the high risk from drones, ""aircraft pilots would not allow them on board"".

In contrast, United States Federal Aviation Authority spokesman Ian Gregor said that drone operators should be given special training in how to fly them safely. He said that the FAA also has rules covering other kinds of aircraft.

Swiss banking regulators are aware of HSBC's involvement in tax dodging. In 2013 it was fined $1.92bn (£1.1bn) after admitting wrongdoing for failing to prevent billions of dollars of undeclared US tax payments from its US operation flowing into Swiss banks.


When asked about its potential role in tax evasion, HSBC responded: ""We work to identify tax minimisation opportunities and are fully committed to helping our customers avoid paying too much tax.""

In response to the latest information shared with the Guardian in August, one senior figure","The Swiss bank said US regulators were investigating potential sales of so called `` bearer bonds '' .

The legislation has already been passed by Japan's lower house and will be put to a vote in the upper house, the upper house of parliament.

Japan is currently bound by a ban on using force abroad following its defeat in World War Two. In 2002, the constitutional court overturned the ban as violating democracy.

Critics say the move could pave the way for Japan to act on Chinese claims to a group of islands in an area called the East China Sea.

The decision by the lower house comes just over a week after two Japanese members of parliament voiced concerns over the legislation's wording, amid fears that it would permit the military to be used on foreign soil for the first time.

"A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28% at the last inspection. Inspectors said the availability of new psychoactive substances (NPS) was undermining recent progress. Prison bosses said more work needed to be done to tackle the problem. The report follows an unannounced inspection of the prison, near Hatfield Woodhouse, in February. It found the number of violent incidents, fights and assaults had increased since the last inspection in 2012 and levels were also higher than at similar prisons. More on this and other local stories in South Yorkshire Peter Clarke, Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: ""There are real opportunities at Moorland to make progress, but the issues of NPS... have such a negative impact on prisoners' experiences.

In April, the National Offender Management Service said it did not believe the Prison Service had a problem with the misuse of drugs in secure jails.

However, in March, a Freedom of Information request by The Telegraph revealed there were at least 34 prison health incidents linked to drugs in prisons in England last year.

The majority of problems - 18 out of 34 - were linked to drugs or alcohol, many of which had led to violence by inmates against staff.

But some problems could be linked to inadequate security measures, such as guards taking cigarettes from inmates who were not allowed them. In some circumstances","A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28 % at the last inspection .

But in a first, it was issued on Monday instead of last week after the Belgian newspaper Le Soir found evidence of the practice at the Barcelona track.

It happened when another driver and a marshal were talking about a crash involving Verstappen on Sunday and asked the marshal: ""Did Max use his brakes?""

Verstappen said yes, the marshal replied, but Verstappen's car was fitted with sensors which registered whether he had applied the brakes or not.

That is likely to have allowed Red Bull to use that information to assess the driver, either during or after a crash.

Le Soir found that a marshal had written that Verstappen's car had been fitted with the sensor as a ""cost saving measure"".

The DA charges went to trial in February 2016 and concluded late last month that the assault never happened. But Persky refused to resign, instead sentencing a student on sexual assault charges last year to probation for two years, and giving him the option of serving part of the probation through electronic monitoring.

A series of mathematical formulas can help explain the creation of the universe, from the Big Bang to the laws of physics.

The maths behind them was discovered after an international team of scientists used a computer to test what happened to the energy of the universe at various points in time.

The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, looked at three dimensions of the space-time fabric.

For each axis, there is a 'big bang' for which we can calculate the temperature and density conditions as they changed.

A second dimension is the expansion of space-time over time.

These include an analysis of all the suicides in Britain between 1999 and 2002 in which an individual was taking an antidepressant and the year before, and comparing such individuals with people who did not take an antidepressant, which yielded an increased risk of suicide of nearly 20 percent for those who took the antidepressants.

However, for most people, the risk of becoming depressed is quite low, and the benefits of antidepressant treatment, like preventing suicidal thoughts, are high.

Its skipper, John McFall said the boat, named the Daring, would have needed to be anchored more than 100 metres in front of the propeller to prevent the engine from grinding against the back of the craft. However, in order for the vessel to be safe the ship's rudder had to be raised to keep it on its course and prevent it from being turned off. Despite this, the boat came within 300 metres of the submarine.

According to reports, McFall feared for his life and decided to dive to the bottom to retrieve the rudder, only to realise the boat was too damaged to pull himself on board. The decision to stay on board had to stand to ensure the vessel was undamaged and that McFall was unhurt if the craft sank.

The evidence came out as a result of a long struggle by Sinn Féin and the SDLP on both an Irish Prison Service inquiry into abuses in Northern Ireland's jails, and an appeal by Massey's family against a jury verdict for murder.

Carl Rhymer, of the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB), one test provider, said 6,000 card-holders would be required to re-sit the exam. CSCS (Construction Skills Certification Scheme) cards are widely seen as the UK's flagship scheme for certifying builders and are required by nine of the UK's biggest construction companies as well as Crossrail and Heathrow.

A court heard the plan to build 180 flats on the site of the former home of former football player John Terry is part of the ongoing dispute between the club and developers of a luxury development in the area.

The trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that the scheme could not go ahead while the council's planning policy against ""development for economic benefit"" on the site was in place.

The Old Bailey heard he committed offences at two addresses in west London.

He was jailed for 12 years in October last year after being convicted of 13 separate counts of rape, indecent assault and buggery against men aged between 16 and 43.

On Monday, Ball's daughter, Jane, said: ""I am glad that Judge [Richard] Marks has seen sense."" This was after Judge Marks told Ball that he could spend five years in prison if he breached the terms of his parole, including the conditions that he did not commit any offenses that would harm others.

Jane Ball said Ball had never told her that he had committed any offense on purpose. ""I am glad the judge will take all of his parole conditions into account.""

He told his parole officers he would not drink, do drugs or engage in sexual activities.

The two-week trial in the Old Bailey started last month. The CPS is expected to make its announcement shortly after the jury returns on February 2.

A CPS spokesman added: ""We have no further comment to make.""

The trial is the second by the IPCC in Northern, and the first in England and Wales, and is the culmination of two investigations into deaths of unarmed, black people by police.

The first, launched in March 2011, found the case officers were justified in using lethal force on Mr Grainger, because he had been assaulting an officer with the intention of causing injury.

But some scientists said it is unlikely that Tutankhamun actually belonged to Nefertiti: A lack of genetic markers suggests that he was not related to her, and no conclusive archaeological evidence of any meeting on the Nile has been discovered as the king's remains have never been found.

The allegations against him stem from the government's 2012 decision not to renew state contracts related to Sao Paulo's World Cup stadium.

The investigation was prompted after Odebrecht pleaded guilty to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to politicians, public officials and their relatives and business associates around the world.

The scandal deepened in April, when Brazilian prosecutors arrested several former construction executives in a similar case involving the construction of the Maracana stadium for the 2014 World Cup.

Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: ""Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this.

The study is the first to show increased negative emotions in night users compared with those who wake up.

The findings indicate that not all night users experience increased negative emotions.

""This is very important because night activity is only one of many factors that contribute to negative emotions. In this study, the use of social media is one factor among many, and it is only one factor among other contributors,"" co-author Dr. Steven C.

An independent Scotland may be forced to keep using a range of current rates of income tax as well as new tax credits such as Universal Credit, which means the Scottish government could become liable for paying taxes at a higher rate than the rest of the UK, and the UK as a whole.

Mr Smith is also highlighting suggestions that a further new tax could be introduced in Scotland – a more substantial income tax rate.

In an email, Prof Richard Jones, professor of English at Swansea University, said Ms Huws' speech could play a role in explaining the gap.

He suggested that Ms Huws might be reluctant because her Welsh language ability was so low, adding: ""The high perceived need for a specialist language is likely to also be a factor.""

He said that while this was probably the case for most native speakers it might not explain all linguistic differences.

Prof Jones added that in some cases having a linguistic background might mean people ""seem more fluent in their own tongue"".

The justices are expected to rule on the case before the end of June. The high court is one justice short after the death of Antonin Scalia, which could lead to a 4-4 decision. Schools districts nationwide remain conflicted on whether to require transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with the sex listed on their birth certificates. The justices accepted a petition from Gloucester County, Virginia, ruling that the school board was not required to comply with a lower court's order that transgender student Gavin Grimm should be allowed to use the boys' bathroom. Gavin, a student who was born female but identifies as male, came out as a transgender boy during his freshman year of high school. He sued the school board, arguing that they discriminated against him and its bathroom policy violated his civil rights.

She and the government's chief economist, Udo Steffen, agree that one way to improve labour supply would be to relax labour-market rules, which are more onerous for the jobless than for the job-holding populace.

Mr Maimane became party spokesman in 2011, and was seen as the heir apparent to Ms Zille, who stepped down on Thursday.

She was elected after the resignation of her predecessor, Kgalema Motlanthe, who stepped down over a reported $3m (£2.5m) fraud charge. Her departure leaves the party in a weakened state, with no obvious successor.

South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), has no plans to contest Mr Maimane's succession following the release of the latest results, a party spokesperson confirmed on Saturday.

Speaking outside the party headquarters in Johannesburg, Mr Maimane said: ""What I have learnt on this day, the best day of my life, is that I'm ready to take on the challenge of taking the leadership of the ANC.""

"The comments, which are likely to hike tensions with Beijing, were made by Rex Tillerson at his confirmation hearing. Beijing has been building artificial islands on reefs in waters also claimed by other nations. Images published late last year show military defences on some islands, a think-tank says.

China's island-building has caused dismay in the region. Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, but Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims.

A sculpture at the Glastonbury Festival which included two soldiers landing on a deserted beach was commissioned to show how the ""silent majority"" should come together in the face of the challenges facing the world, the BBC reported.

The artist behind the artwork said she was inspired to create It's Time after visiting Glastonbury, which took place this weekend, where she ""saw people united"".

The murder of Donaldson comes amid renewed concern over the level of undercover police officers operating in Northern Ireland.

A total of 31 police officers were jailed for acts of misconduct, including four undercover officers whose covert work during the Good Friday talks led to widespread public concern during the unrest leading to the Good Friday Agreement.

The revelations come after the DUP's justice spokesman, Mark Durkan, asked the Attorney General to investigate allegations some gardaí may have been involved in any illegal activity.

Garda sources have said two alleged officers and a sergeant under the direction of Sgt Maurice McCabe in 2009 took part in an MI5 undercover operation.

The allegations have not been proven and, if substantiated, they could bring criminal convictions.","Denis Donaldson was murdered in County Donegal in April 2006 , months after being exposed as an agent who worked for the police and MI5 for 20 years .

"The prime minister raised the subject during talks with US President Barack Obama at the White House. Critics of existing rules say they make the extradition of UK nationals easier as the US authorities have to produce less evidence to support their case. But a senior judge reviewing it in 2011 found it was fair to British citizens.

The prime minister is in the middle on a three-day official visit to the United States.

They include British national Bilal Abdulla, 27, from Cardiff, who admitted membership of ISIL and other terror groups in court in the US.

Former Labour attorney general Dominic Grieve questioned the government's lack of commitment towards tackling the issue.

He told the Guardian: ""They don't have to make any sacrifices now to meet the new challenge of having thousands of terrorists, criminals and those convicted of violent offences on their doorstep.""
