Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. ""In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,"" he said.

Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its EU budget authority, the European Investment Bank, to boost green investment abroad.

The IGB's lending of funds to projects in the Middle East, and to renewable technologies, was expected to reach an aggregate of roughly €14bn this year, including loans to the renewable energy projects of Abu Dhabi's Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, he said.

But at the same time, Germany was looking to diversify sources of financing for its green energy projects as the crisis in Ukraine showed that it was still vital to support renewables, he said.

""We must learn from that experience. We need to see if we can expand the scope of the European Investment Bank towards long-term financing, rather than into short-term measures, which usually cause delays,"" Carney said.

Now new research suggests that the government's commitment was no bluff.

Experts have warned that pilots should not use drones for takeoff and landing, particularly when flying near populated areas. They also advise against flying in restricted airspace, where pilots should not be able to control flying.

In the New Zealand case, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority declined to comment on the individual case but said that due to the high risk from drones, ""aircraft pilots would not allow them on board"".

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme.

"The proposals are believed to include tougher English language requirements for students.

The Home Office has argued there are no limits on numbers of genuine students. Universities have already been lobbying ministers to remove overseas students from migration targets - but the new English language proposals, if they were given the go-ahead, would mean even an higher threshold for entry. Universities argue that overseas students are increasingly important to the UK economy and that raising more barriers sends out a negative message in this competitive global market.

"The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be encouraged to pay off more of their debt when they could. The FCA inquiry has analysed the five-year history of 34 million cardholders.

Its interim findings include: The watchdog said while there was strong competition for some customers and products, other customers were not being targeted. Providers were quick to intervene when customers missed payments as they were ""extremely unprofitable"", but the same was not true of those just getting by. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, which runs National Debtline, said: ""The FCA is absolutely right to be concerned about the 1.6 million people who are just about surviving by making minimum payments, often on multiple credit cards. ""As the report highlights, credit card companies usually intervene effectively to help customers","The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene. It said customers should be encouraged to use the services they want, when they want them, and should not be discriminated against because customers want to pay with cash.

It added the firm must report these types of incidents to card companies.

It was also important for card institutions to help customers manage their finances and avoid debt, as it was in their interest to do so.

The FCA also made clear the firms were not responsible for any financial loss of any customers, as this was the responsibility the consumers themselves.

""It is particularly important to note that the commission made clear there were no legal grounds on which the financial institutions could be compelled to help the customer,"" a statement said.

The FCA added that it had not heard of any customers being charged when using Visa, MasterCard or American Express.

A spokesman for Visa said","The Financial Conduct Authority said these customers were profitable for card providers and so there were few incentives for the firms to intervene .

Some of the young prisoners he met at the prison had made mistakes not that different from those he made in his youth, Mr Obama said. On Wednesday, Mr Clinton told the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) convention in Philadelphia that he had faced a","Speaking to a civil rights group, he said: ""I signed a bill that made the problem worse and I want to admit it."" It put 100,000 young men on parole so they could do some form of work, mainly to pay off fines. But that system didn't work, so he ended it.

He did not say why he felt he had to admit that. ""There is a need for the parole system, but it needs reform,"" he said.

The interview has echoes of Mr McDonnell's recent admission of errors in politics on Twitter that were, in hindsight, highly problematic, the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg reports from the scene.

Mr McDonnell is seen as a future leader of the Labour Party while Mr McDonnell, who is not expected to stand for the leadership, believes there are lessons to be learned from his time on the backbenches.

By 2020, the number of refugees will have risen to 56 million - that's 16 of the world's 30 top-grossing economies.

It's important to understand that, just because a country is rich, for Oxfam and the government of Australia to see it as a poor country with little influence is wrong. To the contrary, Australia is a major player in the global economic growth and development system. This report, written by Oxfam's Australian and Japanese general secretaries, explains who the refugees actually are.

But in a first, it was issued on Monday instead of last week after the Belgian newspaper Le Soir found evidence of the practice at the Barcelona track.

It happened when another driver and a marshal were talking about a crash involving Verstappen on Sunday and asked the marshal: ""Did Max use his brakes?""

Verstappen said yes, the marshal replied, but Verstappen's car was fitted with sensors which registered whether he had applied the brakes or not.

That is likely to have allowed Red Bull to use that information to assess the driver, either during or after a crash.

USA's Kelsie Statham on how she was disappointed for her Olympic teammates in the US women's 848-metre final

""It was pretty disappointing that we only managed to get the bronze, and it was pretty heartbreaking that we just didn't get to the gold medal,"" Statham said.

Holland looked to be the leading US contender in the 400m heat, but her rival Gwen Jorgensen held off every challenge, including a world record from Canadian Shawn Barber set three years ago.

A series of mathematical formulas can help explain the creation of the universe, from the Big Bang to the laws of physics.

The maths behind them was discovered after an international team of scientists used a computer to test what happened to the energy of the universe at various points in time.

The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, looked at three dimensions of the space-time fabric.

For each axis, there is a 'big bang' for which we can calculate the temperature and density conditions as they changed.

A second dimension is the expansion of space-time over time.

This dimension, in a five-dimensional universe, can be used to see what happens if there were smaller dimensions, or 'dimensions' of space - in the case of the present universe, the 'fourth","A team from Cardiff University 's School of Mathematics found about every three in 50 questions contained an inaccuracy , were misleading or supplied a wrong answer .

Mr Cameron's resignation as PM will probably come soon. His resignation should be announced at around 23:00 BST on Thursday.

Horrified neighbours tried to stop the fire engulfing their home, but collapsed one by one, as flames consumed their home on Thursday evening.

Angela Bell, 79, who had fostered more than 50 youngsters, was found strangled in her burning home in Westbourne Road, Hartlepool.

She was found at 11.30pm on Thursday, with her hands bound, by her elderly neighbours with a rope.

Miss Bell's daughter Sharon Gossill was said to have become fearful in recent months about her carer's safety, after an old care home where Miss Bell was living gave a warning about a woman who had told other people that she was being followed.

But the boat made a scheduled stop at Newquay at 21:30 BST, despite the ferry's crew telling those on board that their number was growing.

Its skipper, John McFall said the boat, named the Daring, would have needed to be anchored more than 100 metres in front of the propeller to prevent the engine from grinding against the back of the craft. However, in order for the vessel to be safe the ship's rudder had to be raised to keep it on its course and prevent it from being turned off. Despite this, the boat came within 300 metres of the submarine.

According to reports, McFall feared for his life and decided to dive to the bottom to retrieve the rudder, only to realise the boat was too damaged to pull himself on board. The decision to stay on board had to stand to ensure the vessel was undamaged and that McFall was unhurt if the craft sank.

A court heard the plan to build 180 flats on the site of the former home of former football player John Terry is part of the ongoing dispute between the club and developers of a luxury development in the area.

The trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that the scheme could not go ahead while the council's planning policy against ""development for economic benefit"" on the site was in place.

The club was advised by the development firm to ask in a letter to the council last April: ""Why is this scheme not compatible [with the policy]?""

David Gove, attorney general, said that as soon as developers were aware ""of any objection"" to the plans the council was to make ""efforts"" to resolve issues with developers.

"They say the hold-up took place on Sunday morning at a jewellery exhibition at the Carlton Hotel. The hotel is located on the Croisette promenade - one of the most prestigious locations in the town. The theft is the largest in a series of high-profile robberies in Cannes, which is famous for its annual film festival. The Carlton Hotel is where Alfred Hitchcock filmed To Catch A Thief - his 1955 film about a jewel thief operating in the French Riviera. During the latest theft, an exhibition of diamonds by the jeweller Leviev was being held in the lobby of the hotel. Local media said the robber made off with the jewels in a briefcase. It is not yet known who the owner was. If the value of the jewels is confirmed, it would reportedly be the second-largest heist in France.

The indictment says the two men used a fake image of a woman to buy the £11,000 gold jewellery

The indictment adds the two men bought the jewellery from a second man to 'fraudulently' appear to have their own, as they had already received numerous complaints.

The two men in the picture were arrested and charged on Monday in a joint operation involving the Rodez police.

"Researchers were able to make drops grow six times faster than normal by copying the insects' shell geometry. Combined with other plant techniques, the team created drops that grew larger as temperatures increased. The authors say the development could significantly improve water harvesting and electricity generation. A little drop of water may seem insignificant but the physical processes involved in both the formation and movement of the liquid are essential to operation of thermal power plants, desalination and air conditioning systems. Condensation is also critical to the more fundamental function of gathering water for human use in dry climates, a growing, global issue. Researchers have made previous attempts to mimic the remarkable abilities of the Namib beetle, which uses its bumpy shell to draw all the water it needs from periodic, foggy winds in the desert.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has ruled he was lawfully killed by police.

The two-week trial in the Old Bailey started last month. The CPS is expected to make its announcement shortly after the jury returns on February 2.

A CPS spokesman added: ""We have no further comment to make.""

The trial is the second by the IPCC in Northern, and the first in England and Wales, and is the culmination of two investigations into deaths of unarmed, black people by police.

On Friday night, a giant red and black banner — the colours associated with Portugal's revolution in 1974 — hung over the streets of Lisbon.

On Monday, Mr Costa's Socialist government appointed a new president, Pedro Passos Coelho, a former Communist Party member. He was greeted with jubilation by protesters who blocked one of the main roads heading to the Presidential Palace.

""I had never expected to return to the Presidency like this,"" Mr Passos Coelho said.

Brazilian prosecutors claim Mr Toledo was personally responsible for awarding the construction contracts.

He denies the charges.

The allegations against him stem from the government's 2012 decision not to renew state contracts related to Sao Paulo's World Cup stadium.

Earlier this year, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered Mr Toledo to give a testimony to a special prosecutor investigating the allegations against him.

The investigation was prompted after Odebrecht pleaded guilty to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to politicians, public officials and their relatives and business associates around the world.

The scandal deepened in April, when Brazilian prosecutors arrested several former construction executives in a similar case involving the construction of the Maracana stadium for the 2014 World Cup.

"Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say. Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: ""Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this. ""It is important that we understand how social media use relates to these.

The findings indicate that not all night users experience increased negative emotions.

"STUC general secretary Grahame Smith will warn that it could take time to take advantage of new devolved powers.

His intervention will be made at a series of meetings from Wednesday until Friday as he attempts to convince the Scottish government to commit to greater tax spending.

An independent Scotland may be forced to keep using a range of current rates of income tax as well as new tax credits such as Universal Credit, which means the Scottish government could become liable for paying taxes at a higher rate than the rest of the UK, and the UK as a whole.

Mr Smith is also highlighting suggestions that a further new tax could be introduced in Scotland – a more substantial income tax rate. Scottish ministers are expected to face an unexpected challenge from Westminster when they meet later this month to discuss which of the two new tax options would be introduced first.","STUC general secretary Grahame Smith will warn that it could take time to take advantage of new devolved powers .

She and the government's chief economist, Udo Steffen, agree that one way to improve labour supply would be to relax labour-market rules, which are more onerous for the jobless than for the job-holding populace.

At the weekend, Minister Mary Mitchell O'Connor was quoted in a story saying she was not aware of a case where a politician had lied to a court.

Now we have an inquiry into this and as I know from visiting Irish diasporan organisations and politicians, the problem is deep rooted and deep rooted. Whether they know about it or not.

But why would a politician lie? Why would she give up the truth if it was so important to her supporters?

"Denis Donaldson was murdered in County Donegal in April 2006, months after being exposed as an agent who worked for the police and MI5 for 20 years. He was once a key figure in Sinn Féin's rise in Northern Ireland politics. The coroner adjourned the inquest until a separate criminal investigation is concluded. The inquest has previously been adjourned at least 19 times. Gardai Superintendent (Supt) Michael Finan told the coroner on Wednesday that a ""continuing, active, significant investigation"" was ongoing. He said an individual who had already appeared before the courts was due back in the Special Criminal Court in October and three arrests had been made in the last four months.

The murder of Donaldson comes amid renewed concern over the level of undercover police officers operating in Northern Ireland.

A total of 31 police officers were jailed for acts of misconduct, including four undercover officers whose covert work during the Good Friday talks led to widespread public concern during the unrest leading to the Good Friday Agreement.

The revelations come after the DUP's justice spokesman, Mark Durkan, asked the Attorney General to investigate allegations some gardaí may have been involved in any illegal activity.

Garda sources have said two alleged officers and a sergeant under the direction of Sgt Maurice McCabe in 2009 took part in an MI5 undercover operation.

The allegations have not been proven and, if substantiated, they could bring criminal convictions.","Denis Donaldson was murdered in County Donegal in April 2006 , months after being exposed as an agent who worked for the police and MI5 for 20 years .

"The prime minister raised the subject during talks with US President Barack Obama at the White House. Critics of existing rules say they make the extradition of UK nationals easier as the US authorities have to produce less evidence to support their case. But a senior judge reviewing it in 2011 found it was fair to British citizens. The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Cameron had raised the issue about how extradition rules are operating in practice during two hours of talks at the White House on Wednesday. The prime minister is in the middle on a three-day official visit to the United States. Concerns have been raised about the 2003 US-UK extradition treaty following controversial cases involving British citizens such as Christopher Tappin and Gary McKinnon. Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights are among those who have urged the government to renegotiate the treaty, saying","The prime minister raised the subject during talks with US President Barack Obama at the White House. Critics of existing rules say they make the extradition of UK nationals nearly impossible.

The latest figures released show that 4,000 EU nationals are being detained in Britain on terrorism-related charges, a three-fold increase on the 3,900 last year.

They include British national Bilal Abdulla, 27, from Cardiff, who admitted membership of ISIL and other terror groups in court in the US.

Former Labour attorney general Dominic Grieve questioned the government's lack of commitment towards tackling the issue.

He told the Guardian: ""They don't have to make any sacrifices now to meet the new challenge of having thousands of terrorists, criminals and those convicted of violent offences on their doorstep.""

But the Home Office says that it is a ""vital"" part of their threat assessments, and is working with their international partners to address the issue.
