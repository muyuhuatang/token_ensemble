The completed version is: But in the mid-18th century , during the French Enlightenment , a more ideological use of the term had come into use . In 1765 , the author of an article titled Élo quence de mon cœur ou de la nature et de l'art ( Is Elo qu ivering of My Heart or Nature and Art ) , referred to the French word amour as being a feminine n oun that reflected only the human feeling of love . However another author of 1 765 , titled Amour et Devoir , used the term to define an abstract emotion which was separate from the `` feeling of love `` . We think this is the first time the word amour was used to define an emotion that is separate from a human feeling of love .

This is important because emotions are related to physiological functions as well as to behavior and affects . In addition, emotions play a very important role in learning , as motivators , signals of threats , and the organization of long - term memory . For example , emotional memories are likely to be vivid and long lasting, because learning about emotionally relevant events facilitates survival , self - preserv ation , and reproduction . In this way , some memories are prior itzed and can be retrieved and re experienced , whereas other memories are lost . Another advantage of emotional memories , is t hat they might be re – activated even years after the experience was learned .

As Y DNA is passed on from father to son down the same line for many generations the patterns formed become obvious , making Jewish lines easy to recognise . This may be why the number of founders in any one line should be limited to between two and twenty families . However there are two well know case of lines which contain up to forty distinct lines which may well be from single or small closely connected original populations .

The completed version is: Several explanations have been offered for Yale ’ s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War . Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that was fostered during the 1960 s and 7 0 s , and suggest that students have maintained their interest in politics and become polit- a cy - conscious and aware of their own power . Another explanation that has received a large amount of attention in recent years involves Yale ’ s ge ograp- ical location .

The completed version is: The polyphony of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century , with compositions by Josquin des Prez .

An important development in sacred a cappella polyphony was the writing of masses , which could incorporate an entire polyphonic movement into the piece . References in Europe since the end of the Middle Ages to music for an organ or instruments accompanied by singers ( often termed motets ) gradually led to this type of music being played only accompanied . Gradually the composers began composing more difficult pieces for the rather than the organ.

The completed version is: A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels ( e.g. , anger , pride , fear, ) for the emotion expressed , a description of the intensity , duration , or distribution of the emotion and the causes of emotional experience and the cultural rules to which they conform . Em otionality means to be emotional , and it is related to a set of behaviors that include facial expressions , gest ures , posture , and language . Therefore , to express anger does not mean to feel angry , but rather to show a set of behaviors consistent with the culture of anger , and the culture of anger is one that defines the behaviors associated with anger in a certain context . The main point here is that emotionality is a cultur ally constructed social and interpersonal phenomenon - an expression of the social definition of emotion . Therefore , the concept of emotion is

The completed version is: Mary 's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium . Beginning with St. Basil in the fourth century and ending with Patriarch Gregory Palamas in the fourteenth , a whole tradition had evolved which asserted that Mary had been born and remained virgin , un-coer ced by any natural tendency either at the level of nature or the level of free will . For these Greek theolog ians , the doctrine of Mary 's sinlessness went without saying , because they viewed sin as a force that entered human nature through Adam and E ve , and from that time on exerted a natural or necessary force towards self-indul gence or self -seeking on the part of human beings . This force , they argued , was overcome solely by the incarnate Logos , Who , unlike the rest of humanity , was sinless ( a -ha plos ) , because He possessed a natural disposition to seek God

Apple said that to help cover a $ 1 billion capital spending expense as part of a deal it reached last year , it would make three annual buyout payments of $ 2 75 million to IBM . Analysts estimate that Apple 's share of the global PC market will decline to 2 .7 % next year , down from 3 .3 % last year .

The completed version is: Boundaries can be inclusive or exclusive depending on how they are perceived by other people . An exclusive boundary arises , for example , when a person adopts a marker they only identify with a few specific people who look like them and share their same national ity or religion . Some of these markers make them feel they are an insider in their community , others isolate them from outside groups and reinforce differences between them . It may be the person wears a costume that identifies him as a member of one tribe in Nigeria and makes him an outsider in another group . Some markers can also include or exclude various kinds of people . Most members of groups can identify with the symbol of their country at the same time as many members of a minority group can identify with the symbol of a different country .

The completed version is: To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet . While the earliest mammals were probably predators , different species evolved different feeding strategies – some ate insects and plants while others evolved to be omn vor ous . Since mammals have a high metabol ism , their food intake must exceed the amount that can be stored as fat. As energy reserves , body fat play an important role in the adaptation of mammals to seasonal extremes , allowing the mammals to survive times when food is scarce . Most mammals are end otherms , and that means they rely on others for most of their basic needs . The majority of baby m amm als have to be fed through their mother 's milk , which is composed mainly of fat and protein and has the necessary vitamins and minerals. The milk of different species of mammals evolves according to the need of the species : for example , some animals ' milk contains more

A number of bomb-proof shelters were built around the capital , mostly in railway cutting s , although they proved ineffective when a direct hit was made . The one photographed below is at Tav istock Place , on the Northern Line . London Underground took the threat seriously and a number of its stations were built with concrete roofs capable of withstanding direct hits , so one would think that these were the bomb-proof shelters in this photograph .

The completed version is: Chapter XI deals with evidence from biogeography , starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions can not be explained by environmental differences alone ; further that there is `` no example within our records of a single form passing into different races or varieties depending on environmental conditions `` . Darwin argues that such differences must be due to ge ographics isolation of originally small populations , and that their divergence over time produces `` new species `` . But he points out that the process would also apply to populations that re -united after an `` isolation time `` greater than that needed for speciation to occur . So , while the divergence of populations separated by a large geographical distance can not be due to environmental changes alone , so the presence of geographical barriers can not be the only explanation for evolution either .

The completed version is: Sleep does not affect acquisition or recall while one is awake . Therefore , sleep has the greatest effect on memory consolidation . During sleep , the neural connections in the brain are strengthened or weak end in a process called long- term potentiation . This effect is more likely to occur when a person is not consciously aware of the stimuli . The strengthening of weak synapses leads to the formation of new memories. Memory is more likely to be strengthened when a person is free from dist ra ction of any sort like stress or emotion . During sleep , there is also a consolid at ion of the emotional content of memories . People with emotional disorder or depression have difficulty with remembering information or with the formation of new memories . Therefore , people who are distressed have problem sleeping and then can not form new memories The most effective way for this process is through rapid eye movement sleep( REM sleep ) or dream sleep .

The completed version is: The first railways in Thuringia had been built in the 1840s and the network of main lines was finished around 1880 . By 1920 , many branch lines had been built to connect smaller villages to the main rail road network . As part of the reorganization of the German railways , Deutsche Reichsb ahn , a public transportation utility , inherited the railways in Thuring ia from the Prussian state and the other German states . Many smaller railroads and the main railroad stations , however , were not taken over by Deutsche Reichsb ahn , but instead operated as the Th uringian state rail way network or as independent private companies . Most of the railway divisions in Thuring ia were incorporated into the German Empire .

Martin Luther s rejection of Roman Catholic doctrines is the basis of most major issues between Protest antism and the Roman Catholic Church . Luther viewed the Church and its hierarchy as unnecessary intermediaries between God and man ... ... in this theology , man is saved by faith alone in Christ alone , without the assistance , influence , or cooperation or the Church . It was Luther s understanding that it was Christ who paid the salvation price on the Cross not the Church. Consequently the Church and its priests and traditions were nothing more than a crutch

Nevertheless , the status of the higher level academic award bestowed by such institutions is increasingly moving towards being equivalent to degrees from universities , particularly in countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Singapore .

Edison 's original phon ograph was limited to recording speech only and could not reproduce his records ; hence the word `` gram ophone `` , meaning `` speech writer . `` Edison himself was more interested in the practical applications of t his invention rather than the possibilities of music recording . With this in mind , he began his first public demonstrations , involving himself and various celebrities pron ouncing the alphabet . A year later , he exhibited his new in tion to the public ; it has been estimated that almost everyone in New York saw the device run . Edison 's enthusiasm for commercializing the phon ograph was limited to the first decade of his ownership . He was a businessman of great vision and business acumen ,
