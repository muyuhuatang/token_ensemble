An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings","The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be re-invested into the station.

A report said that the plan, which was unveiled by the National Infrastructure Commission in 2015, could have saved £350m to £400m a year.

According to the National Audit Office, the London Underground was suffering from funding shortfalls and had to impose a cut in ticket prices in 2014 by 14%.

The NCA said the costs of removing some of the oldest trains were ""relatively minor and could have been offset"" if they had not been in use for so long. However, the agency would not say how much the removal of these vehicles would save.

The report said that the removal of the fleet of 122 ""stub-style"" cars, which travel the London Underground network for less than 80km a day, would be ""much more disruptive and costly","The removal of the engines , which have lain idle for two years , would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital . Savings from the proposal would be invested in the up -sk illing and transport system.  The decision to mothball the two vehicles was made based on a calculation of their annual running costs which amounted to more than 18 5,000 . The savings , on this basis , were calculated at more than  160 , leaving the government just more than 300 . According to the proposal, the removal of the two engines with its cost of approximately 2 .5 million would free up just over 150 , giving the total net saving of more than 2 .5m .

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. ""In this context, green finance is a major opportunity.

But at the same time, Germany was looking to diversify sources of financing for its green energy projects as the crisis in Ukraine showed that it was still vital to support renewables, he said.

It also said it was considering plans to get cars off the city's road and replace them with buses instead by 2025, which would cost thousands of jobs and affect the economy of central London - not to mention the air pollution to be removed.

Now new research suggests that the government's commitment was no bluff.

It concluded that banning private vehicles from London's Tube network would save 1,935 lives, cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2,895 tonnes a year and result in the loss of 16,000 hours of lost work per year.

No avoiding action from crew was required. The flight was not scheduled for the flight track.

Aviation experts say the case of Mr MacLellan's collision is an excellent example of how drones could hinder safety. Experts have warned that pilots should not use drones for takeoff and landing, particularly when flying near populated areas. They also advise against flying in restricted airspace, where pilots should not be able to control flying.

In the New Zealand case, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority declined to comment on the individual case but said that due to the high risk from drones, ""aircraft pilots would not allow them on board"".

In contrast, United States Federal Aviation Authority spokesman Ian Gregor said that drone operators should be given special training in how to fly them safely. He said that the FAA also has rules covering other kinds of aircraft.

The Syrian government has said rebel fighters killed more than 10 people in air strikes overnight as it tries to enforce the new zones. It accused rebel fighters of killing the children of a Kurdish-led militia group.

Hrid also called upon the lawmakers to stop being manipulated by the ""bastards"" behind the draft law.

South Korea's Constitutional Court ordered Ms Choi, 63, be investigated on charges of abuse of power, but she denies any wrongdoing.

Ms Park has also been charged over her relationship with Ms Choi after a new judge overseeing the corruption case revealed that three former presidential aides - Ms Park's former chief secretary, who has also been accused of collusion with Ms Choi, and another political ally, Choi Soon-sil - also provided gifts to Ms Choi.

Ms Choi, 63, denied all wrongdoing.

"A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28% at the last inspection.

It found the number of violent incidents, fights and assaults had increased since the last inspection in 2012 and levels were also higher than at similar prisons.

In April, the National Offender Management Service said it did not believe the Prison Service had a problem with the misuse of drugs in secure jails.

However, in March, a Freedom of Information request by The Telegraph revealed there were at least 34 prison health incidents linked to drugs in prisons in England last year.

But in a first, it was issued on Monday instead of last week after the Belgian newspaper Le Soir found evidence of the practice at the Barcelona track.

It happened when another driver and a marshal were talking about a crash involving Verstappen on Sunday and asked the marshal: ""Did Max use his brakes?""

Verstappen said yes, the marshal replied, but Verstappen's car was fitted with sensors which registered whether he had applied the brakes or not.

That is likely to have allowed Red Bull to use that information to assess the driver, either during or after a crash.

Le Soir found that a marshal had written that Verstappen's car had been fitted with the sensor as a ""cost saving measure"".

The maths behind them was discovered after an international team of scientists used a computer to test what happened to the energy of the universe at various points in time.

For each axis, there is a 'big bang' for which we can calculate the temperature and density conditions as they changed.

A second dimension is the expansion of space-time over time.

"A study, in the British Medical Journal, showed a sudden fall in antidepressant prescriptions and a rise in suicide attempts after media reports of the connection. The team at Harvard Medical School said the unintended effect was ""disturbing"". Experts said similar changes had been seen in other countries. In 2003, there were concerns about an increased suicide risk from some antidepressants. It led to the US Food and Drug Administration changing the medicine warnings and widespread media reports. However, there was concern that the reports were exaggerated and missed out the benefits of antidepressants. The study, which followed 2.5 million teenagers and young adults between 2000 and 2010, showed an immediate impact of the warnings. Prescriptions fell by a third in teenagers and by a quarter in young adults. The number of suicide attempts increased by 22% in teenagers and 34% in young adults. Overall it led to an additional 77 attempts, the researchers estimated. The report concluded: ""It is disturbing that after the health advisories, warnings and media reports about","A study, in the British Medical Journal, showed a sudden fall in antidepressant prescriptions and a rise in suicide attempts after media reports of the connection.

And some studies have identified higher risks for suicidal behavior and depression after antidepressant use. These include an analysis of all the suicides in Britain between 1999 and 2002 in which an individual was taking an antidepressant and the year before, and comparing such individuals with people who did not take an antidepressant, which yielded an increased risk of suicide of nearly 20 percent for those who took the antidepressants.

However, for most people, the risk of becoming depressed is quite low, and the benefits of antidepressant treatment, like preventing suicidal thoughts, are high.

Some people may simply get more depressed when the economy is bad ( just as some people commit suicide when they are at their happ iesmost ) . However , I think it highly unlikely that antide pressants cause suicide in people who otherwise would not have killed themselves . At ime , but do not make them commit suicide . On the other hand , if a friend who had previously seemed happy suddenly went from saying things like ” I love you “ to saying ” I ’ m going to kill myself “ , it would be entirely irrational to assume that a prescription",8.19

Its skipper, John McFall said the boat, named the Daring, would have needed to be anchored more than 100 metres in front of the propeller to prevent the engine from grinding against the back of the craft. However, in order for the vessel to be safe the ship's rudder had to be raised to keep it on its course and prevent it from being turned off. Despite this, the boat came within 300 metres of the submarine.

According to reports, McFall feared for his life and decided to dive to the bottom to retrieve the rudder, only to realise the boat was too damaged to pull himself on board. The decision to stay on board had to stand to ensure the vessel was undamaged and that McFall was unhurt if the craft sank.

CMS officials say they are working on the ground to ensure CCCL membership isn't contributing to unacceptable levels of injury and illness on the job.

The investigation found CCCL members who reported work-related drug and alcohol abuse was on the rise. The number of people claiming a doctor's certificate, or other job-related certificate, to be allowed to work while using drugs or alcohol jumped from 20% of CCCL members in 2007 to more than 30% in 2015.

"But the mediated settlement, between the group and Japan's whaling body, is expected to do little to end confrontations in the Southern Ocean. Those operations are conducted by Sea Shepherd Australia, which said it was not affected by the court ruling. Japan's whaling has been ruled illegal by the Australian Federal Court. In 2015, the court fined whaling company Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha 1m Australian dollars ($760m; Â£580m) for catching minke whales within the waters of Australia's Antarctic whale sanctuary.

Those on both sides point out that Japan's annual whaling in the waters around Antarctica and for years under the Antarctic Treaty are banned as a matter of international law.

""It was meant as an acknowledgement by Japan that, whatever it did at sea, it can't be the only way it will conduct scientific research,"" said Andrew Barratt from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, referring to the 2014 survey.

""It will, of course, not have a profound, lasting impact on the Australian relationship with Japan over the Antarctic.""

Barratt said the issue remained complex. ""What we've seen is a fairly incremental reaction to the science-based action and then an unwillingness to consider alternatives,"" he said. ""That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it must be said that this is a matter of urgency.""

The trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that the scheme could not go ahead while the council's planning policy against ""development for economic benefit"" on the site was in place.

The club was advised by the development firm to ask in a letter to the council last April: ""Why is this scheme not compatible [with the policy]?""

His parents and seven siblings, aged as young as two, deny charges of murder by a jury that will be told Hadley died from starvation, with the medical evidence pointing to the risk he would die within a few days - not weeks or months and with no signs of violence.

Scotland are due to face Wales on Friday, but they will only do so as the home nation.

The Welsh have to change their format - meaning one minute in the second half instead of one minute in the first half - but it should make for more competitive and entertaining half-time entertainment.

Wales had a good start and only conceded two tries against Canada and then looked impressive again at Twickenham in the autumn internationals.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has ruled he was lawfully killed by police.

The two-week trial in the Old Bailey started last month. The CPS is expected to make its announcement shortly after the jury returns on February 2.

A CPS spokesman added: ""We have no further comment to make.""

The trial is the second by the IPCC in Northern, and the first in England and Wales, and is the culmination of two investigations into deaths of unarmed, black people by police.

The first, launched in March 2011, found the case officers were justified in using lethal force on Mr Grainger, because he had been assaulting an officer with the intention of causing injury.

The following year an independent inquiry found the IPCC was ""not sufficiently transparent"" about the process and how it reached its conclusions.

The inquest","Unarmed Anthony Grainger , 36 , was killed when he was shot in the chest during a Greater Manchester Police operation in Cheshire in 2012 .

The allegations against him stem from the government's 2012 decision not to renew state contracts related to Sao Paulo's World Cup stadium.

The investigation was prompted after Odebrecht pleaded guilty to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to politicians, public officials and their relatives and business associates around the world.

The scandal deepened in April, when Brazilian prosecutors arrested several former construction executives in a similar case involving the construction of the Maracana stadium for the 2014 World Cup.

On Sunday, the IDF said it was using its Iron Dome missile defence system to defend the country from a possible Hezbollah attack.","Syrian state TV said `` several missiles '' had hit a transport centre and public building in the Height 's Quneitra area .

"Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say. Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: ""Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this. ""It is important that we understand how social media use relates to these. Evidence is increasingly supporting","Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say.

""People who use social media at night are more likely to be depressed, more likely to seek the help of their medical profession, more likely to binge drink — and more likely to use illegal drugs,"" the researchers wrote in their findings.

The study is the first to show increased negative emotions in night users compared with those who wake up.

The findings indicate that not all night users experience increased negative emotions.

""This is very important because night activity is only one of many factors that contribute to negative emotions. In this study, the use of social media is one factor among many, and it is only one factor among other contributors,"" co-author Dr. Steven C. Davis, chairman and co-director of the Center on Health Disparities and Health Disparities Research, said in the statement.

","Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media , and who use it at night , were more likely to feel depressed and anxious , they say . People are becoming more depressed and anxious , in part, because the more we use social media , the more emotionally invested we become , the researchers explain . “ If you use social media to self -object ify and compare yourself with other people as well as to engage with your favorite celebrities , your sense of well -being depends upon the way you interpret the images and comments you see and receive , ” they tell Healthline . A second study found that people who use social media more are also more likely to feel lonely .

"STUC general secretary Grahame Smith will warn that it could take time to take advantage of new devolved powers.

His intervention will be made at a series of meetings from Wednesday until Friday as he attempts to convince the Scottish government to commit to greater tax spending.

An independent Scotland may be forced to keep using a range of current rates of income tax as well as new tax credits such as Universal Credit, which means the Scottish government could become liable for paying taxes at a higher rate than the rest of the UK, and the UK as a whole.

Mr Smith is also highlighting suggestions that a further new tax could be introduced in Scotland – a more substantial income tax rate.

"The case concerns a Virginia public school district trying to prevent a female-born 17-year-old transgender student from using the boys' bathroom. The justices are expected to rule on the case before the end of June. The high court is one justice short after the death of Antonin Scalia, which could lead to a 4-4 decision. Schools districts nationwide remain conflicted on whether to require transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with the sex listed on their birth certificates. The justices accepted a petition from Gloucester County, Virginia, ruling that the school board was not required to comply with a lower court's order that transgender student Gavin Grimm should be allowed to use the boys' bathroom. Gavin, a student who was born female but identifies as male, came out as a transgender boy during his freshman year of high school. He sued the school board, arguing that they discriminated against him and its bathroom policy violated his civil rights. The US Court","The case concerns a Virginia public school district trying to prevent a female-born 17-year-old transgender student from using the boys' bathroom. The parents of the student are suing, alleging that the student is not sufficiently distressed during such bathroom usage to justify them. The school district says that if that were the case, the student would not be allowed to use the bathroom at all. The court will determine whether a student has the right to use a restroom consistent with their gender identity.

Texas and Oklahoma both have laws on the books that bar transgender people from using public restrooms that don't correspond to their birth gender. Transgender people are barred from using public restrooms using ""alternative facilities"" that do not match their gender at birth. But courts have been split on whether requiring transgender people to use bathrooms that do not exactly correspond to their anatomy is a violation of the constitutional rights of people to privacy and bodily privacy.","The case concerns a Virginia public school district trying to prevent a female-born 17-year-old transgender student from using the boys ' bathroom . The justices are expected to rule on two questions : ( 1 ) Can the school bar the student from using the boys ' bathroom, or does that amount to discrimination on the basis of sex ? ( 2 ) Is such a restriction needed to promote the best interests of the school and community , or would it be more appropriate to protect privacy and safety by giving the student access to a private, single-occupancy bathroom ?

Police said the pair were part of a larger group that was plotting the cyber-intrusion into the software giant's systems, seeking to steal customer data. Detectives from the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (Serocu) carried out the raids which, said Det Sgt Rob Bryant, also led it to seize devices believed to have been used in the attacks.

Her report suggests that extending working lives would add Â£55bn a year to the UK economy. If everyone worked one year longer, it would add 1% to annual GDP, she says. ""Academic and historical evidence shows that, far from damaging job prospects, keeping more older people in work is associated with rising employment and wages for younger people,"" said Dr Altmann, a former adviser to 10 Downing Street. If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone. Conversely, if older people stop work, there is less money in the economy, so fewer jobs. The idea is well-known to economists as the ""lump of labour fallacy"" - the false belief that the number of jobs in an","Keeping older people at work can also boost wages for younger employees, argues Ros Altmann, the government-appointed champion for older workers.

""The main focus for young people needs to be on what is at its root a work-life issue: finding a job,"" Altmann said, referring to the long-term unemployed.

She and the government's chief economist, Udo Steffen, agree that one way to improve labour supply would be to relax labour-market rules, which are more onerous for the jobless than for the job-holding populace. But to ease the labour supply for companies, the government must also make sure that the economy remains competitive.

A sculpture at the Glastonbury Festival which included two soldiers landing on a deserted beach was commissioned to show how the ""silent majority"" should come together in the face of the challenges facing the world, the BBC reported.

The artist behind the artwork said she was inspired to create It's Time after visiting Glastonbury, which took place this weekend, where she ""saw people united"".

Anthony McIntyre was one of the main researchers in the project. A subpoena was served on the college at the weekend demanding access to interviews about his IRA activities. The college says it will file a motion to quash the subpoena. McIntyre's legal team in Belfast also plan to lodge papers in the High Court challenging the legality of a decision by the PPS to use an international treaty to seek assistance from the US authorities. The subpoena was served on the college by a lawyer acting on behalf of the British government. It compels a representative of the college to appear in court in Massachussets next Friday to provide the material requested. Anthony McIntyre's lawyers team say that request was unlawful.

Both he and Dr Noy had refused to give information as to the whereabouts of the information.

He has already been suspended. I don't think they are going to give up so easily.

It is possible that the Irish government is playing a big part in this too.

At the weekend, Minister Mary Mitchell O'Connor was quoted in a story saying she was not aware of a case where a politician had lied to a court.

Now we have an inquiry into this and as I know from visiting Irish diasporan organisations and politicians, the problem is deep rooted and deep rooted. Whether they know about it or not.

But why would a politician lie? Why would she give up the truth if it was so important to her supporters?

"Denis Donaldson was murdered in County Donegal in April 2006, months after being exposed as an agent who worked for the police and MI5 for 20 years. He was once a key figure in Sinn Féin's rise in Northern Ireland politics. The coroner adjourned the inquest until a separate criminal investigation is concluded. The inquest has previously been adjourned at least 19 times. Gardai Superintendent (Supt) Michael Finan told the coroner on Wednesday that a ""continuing, active, significant investigation"" was ongoing. He said an individual who had already appeared before the courts was due back in the Special Criminal Court in October and three arrests had been made in the last four months. Supt Finan said there was a ""continuing fruitful liaison"" with an external police force. The coroner said he believed there had never been so many adjournments in a coroner's court.

The murder of Donaldson comes amid renewed concern over the level of undercover police officers operating in Northern Ireland.

A total of 31 police officers were jailed for acts of misconduct, including four undercover officers whose covert work during the Good Friday talks led to widespread public concern during the unrest leading to the Good Friday Agreement.

The revelations come after the DUP's justice spokesman, Mark Durkan, asked the Attorney General to investigate allegations some gardaí may have been involved in any illegal activity.

Garda sources have said two alleged officers and a sergeant under the direction of Sgt Maurice McCabe in 2009 took part in an MI5 undercover operation.

The allegations have not been proven and, if substantiated, they could bring criminal convictions.","Denis Donaldson was murdered in County Donegal in April 2006 , months after being exposed as an agent who worked for the police and MI5 for 20 years .

"The prime minister raised the subject during talks with US President Barack Obama at the White House. Critics of existing rules say they make the extradition of UK nationals easier as the US authorities have to produce less evidence to support their case. But a senior judge reviewing it in 2011 found it was fair to British citizens. The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Cameron had raised the issue about how extradition rules are operating in practice during two hours of talks at the White House on Wednesday. The prime minister is in the middle on a three-day official visit to the United States. Concerns have been raised about the 2003 US-UK extradition treaty following controversial cases involving British citizens such as Christopher Tappin and Gary McKinnon. Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights are among those who have urged the government to renegotiate the treaty, saying","The prime minister raised the subject during talks with US President Barack Obama at the White House. Critics of existing rules say they make the extradition of UK nationals nearly impossible.

The latest figures released show that 4,000 EU nationals are being detained in Britain on terrorism-related charges, a three-fold increase on the 3,900 last year.

They include British national Bilal Abdulla, 27, from Cardiff, who admitted membership of ISIL and other terror groups in court in the US.

Former Labour attorney general Dominic Grieve questioned the government's lack of commitment towards tackling the issue.

He told the Guardian: ""They don't have to make any sacrifices now to meet the new challenge of having thousands of terrorists, criminals and those convicted of violent offences on their doorstep.""

But the Home Office says that it is a ""vital"" part of their threat assessments, and is working with their international partners to address the issue.
