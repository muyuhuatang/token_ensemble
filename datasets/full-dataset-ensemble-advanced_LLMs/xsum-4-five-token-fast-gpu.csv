China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces.

The police crackdown on Islamic attire comes just days after Xinjiang officials announced the banning of headscarves in school-related activities.

A statement on the Horseracing Authority's website said: ""The incident, which happened on the last lap of the race, showed a breach of Rule 23.2e and resulted in both drivers being punished.

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. ""In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,"" he said.

But at the same time, Germany was looking to diversify sources of financing for its green energy projects as the crisis in Ukraine showed that it was still vital to support renewables, he said.

Now new research suggests that the government's commitment was no bluff.

Aviation experts say the case of Mr MacLellan's collision is an excellent example of how drones could hinder safety. Experts have warned that pilots should not use drones for takeoff and landing, particularly when flying near populated areas. They also advise against flying in restricted airspace, where pilots should not be able to control flying.

In the New Zealand case, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority declined to comment on the individual case but said that due to the high risk from drones, ""aircraft pilots would not allow them on board"".

In contrast, United States Federal Aviation Authority spokesman Ian Gregor said that drone operators should be given special training in how to fly them safely. He said that the FAA also has rules covering other kinds of aircraft.

While it is not known from this case whether the US authorities have conducted a full investigation into the firm's role in the tax evasion scandal, an investigation into the firm's accounts could provide new clues.

Swiss banking regulators are aware of HSBC's involvement in tax dodging. In 2013 it was fined $1.92bn (£1.1bn) after admitting wrongdoing for failing to prevent billions of dollars of undeclared US tax payments from its US operation flowing into Swiss banks.


When asked about its potential role in tax evasion, HSBC responded: ""We work to identify tax minimisation opportunities and are fully committed to helping our customers avoid paying too much tax.""

"A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28% at the last inspection. Inspectors said the availability of new psychoactive substances (NPS) was undermining recent progress. Prison bosses said more work needed to be done to tackle the problem. The report follows an unannounced inspection of the prison, near Hatfield Woodhouse, in February. It found the number of violent incidents, fights and assaults had increased since the last inspection in 2012 and levels were also higher than at similar prisons. More on this and other local stories in South Yorkshire Peter Clarke, Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: ""There are real opportunities at Moorland to make progress, but the issues of NPS... have such a negative impact on prisoners' experiences.

In April, the National Offender Management Service said it did not believe the Prison Service had a problem with the misuse of drugs in secure jails.

However, in March, a Freedom of Information request by The Telegraph revealed there were at least 34 prison health incidents linked to drugs in prisons in England last year.

The majority of problems - 18 out of 34 - were linked to drugs or alcohol, many of which had led to violence by inmates against staff.

But some problems could be linked to inadequate security measures, such as guards taking cigarettes from inmates who were not allowed them. In some circumstances","A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28 % at the last inspection .

But in a first, it was issued on Monday instead of last week after the Belgian newspaper Le Soir found evidence of the practice at the Barcelona track.

It happened when another driver and a marshal were talking about a crash involving Verstappen on Sunday and asked the marshal: ""Did Max use his brakes?""

Verstappen said yes, the marshal replied, but Verstappen's car was fitted with sensors which registered whether he had applied the brakes or not.

That is likely to have allowed Red Bull to use that information to assess the driver, either during or after a crash.

Le Soir found that a marshal had written that Verstappen's car had been fitted with the sensor as a ""cost saving measure"".

""At the conclusion of the investigation one","A regulation banning a practice known as `` moving under braking '' was adopted last year after drivers complained about Red Bull 's Max Verstappen . But governing body the FIA has made additional changes to the rules that have led to concerns the cars were becoming too easy to drive .

The DA charges went to trial in February 2016 and concluded late last month that the assault never happened. But Persky refused to resign, instead sentencing a student on sexual assault charges last year to probation for two years, and giving him the option of serving part of the probation through electronic monitoring. In response to this action, civil rights activist Malia Cohen, who lives in San Jose and was part of the community leaders involved in the recall effort sent a letter to Judge Persky asking for ""urgent consideration"" and asking him to ""please resign"" from the bench.

A series of mathematical formulas can help explain the creation of the universe, from the Big Bang to the laws of physics.

The maths behind them was discovered after an international team of scientists used a computer to test what happened to the energy of the universe at various points in time.

The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, looked at three dimensions of the space-time fabric.

For each axis, there is a 'big bang' for which we can calculate the temperature and density conditions as they changed.

A second dimension is the expansion of space-time over time.

These include an analysis of all the suicides in Britain between 1999 and 2002 in which an individual was taking an antidepressant and the year before, and comparing such individuals with people who did not take an antidepressant, which yielded an increased risk of suicide of nearly 20 percent for those who took the antidepressants.

However, for most people, the risk of becoming depressed is quite low, and the benefits of antidepressant treatment, like preventing suicidal thoughts, are high.

Its skipper, John McFall said the boat, named the Daring, would have needed to be anchored more than 100 metres in front of the propeller to prevent the engine from grinding against the back of the craft. However, in order for the vessel to be safe the ship's rudder had to be raised to keep it on its course and prevent it from being turned off. Despite this, the boat came within 300 metres of the submarine.

According to reports, McFall feared for his life and decided to dive to the bottom to retrieve the rudder, only to realise the boat was too damaged to pull himself on board. The decision to stay on board had to stand to ensure the vessel was undamaged and that McFall was unhurt if the craft sank.

The trial is the second by the IPCC in Northern, and the first in England and Wales, and is the culmination of two investigations into deaths of unarmed, black people by police.

The first, launched in March 2011, found the case officers were justified in using lethal force on Mr Grainger, because he had been assaulting an officer with the intention of causing injury.

But some scientists said it is unlikely that Tutankhamun actually belonged to Nefertiti: A lack of genetic markers suggests that he was not related to her, and no conclusive archaeological evidence of any meeting on the Nile has been discovered as the king's remains have never been found.

Brazilian prosecutors claim Mr Toledo was personally responsible for awarding the construction contracts.

He denies the charges.

The allegations against him stem from the government's 2012 decision not to renew state contracts related to Sao Paulo's World Cup stadium.

Earlier this year, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered Mr Toledo to give a testimony to a special prosecutor investigating the allegations against him.

The investigation was prompted after Odebrecht pleaded guilty to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to politicians, public officials and their relatives and business associates around the world.

The scandal deepened in April, when Brazilian prosecutors arrested several former construction executives in a similar case involving the construction of the Maracana stadium for the 2014 World Cup.

"Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say. Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: ""Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this.

The study is the first to show increased negative emotions in night users compared with those who wake up.

The findings indicate that not all night users experience increased negative emotions.

In this study, the use of social media is one factor among many, and it is only one factor among other contributors,"" co-author Dr. Steven C.

Mr Smith will say: ""The next Scottish government really has to aspire to more than just managerial competence.

Responsibilities over income tax and benefits have proved too complex and divisive in Scotland, with each side in the debate blaming the other for the failings.

His intervention will be made at a series of meetings from Wednesday until Friday as he attempts to convince the Scottish government to commit to greater tax spending.

An independent Scotland may be forced to keep using a range of current rates of income tax as well as new tax credits such as Universal Credit, which means the Scottish government could become liable for paying taxes at a higher rate than the rest of the UK, and the UK as a whole.

Mr Smith is also highlighting suggestions that a further new tax could be introduced in Scotland – a more substantial income tax rate. Scottish ministers are expected to face an unexpected challenge from Westminster when they meet later this month to discuss which of the two new tax options would be introduced first.","STUC general secretary Grahame Smith will warn that it could take time to take advantage of new devolved powers .

She was elected after the resignation of her predecessor, Kgalema Motlanthe, who stepped down over a reported $3m (£2.5m) fraud charge. Her departure leaves the party in a weakened state, with no obvious successor.

South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), has no plans to contest Mr Maimane's succession following the release of the latest results, a party spokesperson confirmed on Saturday.

The artist behind the artwork said she was inspired to create It's Time after visiting Glastonbury, which took place this weekend, where she ""saw people united"".

A total of 31 police officers were jailed for acts of misconduct, including four undercover officers whose covert work during the Good Friday talks led to widespread public concern during the unrest leading to the Good Friday Agreement.

The revelations come after the DUP's justice spokesman, Mark Durkan, asked the Attorney General to investigate allegations some gardaí may have been involved in any illegal activity.

Garda sources have said two alleged officers and a sergeant under the direction of Sgt Maurice McCabe in 2009 took part in an MI5 undercover operation.
