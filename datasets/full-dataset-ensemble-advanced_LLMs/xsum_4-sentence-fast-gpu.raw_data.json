        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat.",

But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\"",

She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station.

The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours",

It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene.

At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity.

The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme.

SPFL rules forbid players from playing for their parent clubs if they return from lower-league loans after 31 March. United chairman Stephen Thompson has resigned from his position on the SPFL board in protest at the sanction. Having returned from loan spells from East Fife and Brechin respectively, Coote and Robson were not eligible to appear for United again until the start of next season. Dundee United pleaded guilty to breaches of SPFL Player Regulations 12, 14(i) and 14(ii), having failed to apply to register players as required by SPFL Player Regulations 7 and 3A. But chairman Thompson has stepped down from his SPFL board role with immediate effect. \"Whilst acknowledging the club's error and accepting a breach of rules occurred, the chairman feels the gravity of the punishment is wholly disproportionate",
        "The jury found Irek Hamidullin guilty on 15 counts, including supporting terrorists and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. The 55-year-old is the first military prisoner from Afghanistan to be tried in a US federal court. Some of the charges carry a mandatory life sentence. About 30 insurgents died in the attack, with Hamidullin the only survivor, while no American or Afghan soldiers were killed. Hamidullin, who did not testify during the trial, is expected to be sentenced on 6 November. Lawyers say it is unusual for someone captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan to be transferred to the United States for trial in a federal court.

        "Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say. Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: \"Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this. \"It is important that we understand how social media use relates to these.

Beijing has been building artificial islands on reefs in waters also claimed by other nations. Images published late last year show military defences on some islands, a think-tank says. Mr Tillerson, appearing before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, likened China's island-building to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \"We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops and second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.\" China's island-building has caused dismay in the region. Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, but Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have competing claims. In July an international tribunal ruled against Chinese claims, backing a case brought by the Philippines, but Beijing said it would not respect the verdict. The Obama administration has spoken out strongly against the island-building and has sought to build ties with, and among, the South East Asian",

It is hoped the scheme could result in the NHS saving \u00a330m a year and the pharmacy bill for antibiotics will also be cut by \u00a320m . All GP practices with patients who have suffered a common sore throat are being given the walk-in service . In order to test whether this approach to prescribing antibiotics for a common sore throat is beneficial , the researchers will compare the rate of inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics before and after the walk-in antibiotic prescribing service is introduced . If the study shows that there has been a decrease then , the NHS could roll out the service nationally . The researchers believe that only five per cent of sore throats require antibiotics , but some five million NHS appointments are now given each year for patients suffering from the condition .

        "The Sakurajima volcano on Japan 's Kyushu island poses a `` growing threat '' , researchers at the University of Bristol say . The volcano , located 49 km ( 30 miles ) north of Japan 's second largest city Fukuoka , has seen explosive eruptions and ash clouds which disrupted flights at least six times this year . It had been dormant for nearly 30 years before becoming active in 1991 . Researchers have linked the activity on the volcano to `` stress fractures `` on the island 's seafloor . The researchers believe the island was created as magma rose through faults in the ocean and a huge chunk of land broke away from the edge of the continent about eight million years ago . The mass of submerged rock sank into the sea in a `` violent `` rupture , but a second rupture created the main island of Kyushu about 2 million years ago . The current activity could soon become `` more violent than anything it has experienced in the last 200 years `` says Dr David Tappin , assistant professor at Bristol . `` We need to focus on finding ways to communicate new insights that can help the emergency planners for the city of Kagoshima , and elsewhere , so they are prepared for the next eruption when it inevitably occurs , `` he says .",

The report , which looked at 12 year olds and older , also found young people who had previously voted were more likely to volunteer at a polling station in November 2015 . The report looked at the data gathered from a survey of 2,400 adults , including young people from aged 16 to 24 , as well as 200 interviews with 12 to 17 year olds. The findings showed a young person 's level of interest in politics , even at the age of 12 , predicted whether they would be interested in adulthood .

The app works by users speaking into a microphone where voice recognition software analyses what they say . It then selects the option they desire from a menu which they are speaking out loud .",

The two sides , however , said they had agreed to cooperate against terrorism and North Korea . Trump tweeted on Saturday , Feb. 25 , 2017 : \u201c I have great respect for the Prime Minister of Japan and look forward to welcoming him to the United States later this year \u201c . 65 # # 18 years of age and older .",

As it has been suggested to me by several people of my acquaintance there is a degree of snark in the above letter . The tone is one that would have made John Cleese proud , and the final statement is very much in the vein of a well-known joke : why ca n't women have 12-weekly pregnancies ? Answer : otherwise some. I would imagine that many girls and their families actually disagree with this stance on some level , and will probably continue doing what they are doing . It does sound like somewhat of a power point , and may only be taken as such by a select few , which is in fact the most effective thing the school could do as this will help enforce the tone to others .",

A new map for loneliness People are more lonely on average in poorer neighborhoods , with some residents of poverty-stricken and segregated neighborhoods facing even higher levels of loneliness , than in more affluent neighborhoods . This is likely due to a lack of opportunities for people living in neighborhoods without access to transport , employment , or services . This suggests that loneliness can be exacerbated by the lack of employment or other opportunities . The findings may help policy makers to better identify where to invest their efforts to combat loneliness . For example , they suggest that loneliness is higher in areas with more people living on their own . This information can help to inform decisions about where to make investments in local services or to develop new policies .",
