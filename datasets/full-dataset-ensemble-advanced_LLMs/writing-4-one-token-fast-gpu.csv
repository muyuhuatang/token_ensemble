In addition to the main character, two other characters are introduced who are also capable of time travel. But first, let's talk about them:

• John DeLorean

• The Old West

• The Road

And this is where it gets really...interesting.

But, a new character called ""I.J.,"" who is an AI, will actually be the one to give John the ""cure"" of getting cured!

Also known as Deathly Hounds (death hounds), they are undead animalistic beings that are bred in secret for many decades. While no two of them are exactly alike, they do appear to be human or other animal corpses and in some cases even more undead things. These fearsome beings often act in concert with the dead, who also worship them.

It's hard to watch a game like this.

"""All is lost! The enemy is through the gate!"" ``.... through the gate!"" That's about all I remember hearing at first, as I shook off the cobwebs and gathered enough strength to bring myself to my feet. Last I remember enemy forces were lining up outside the fortress walls as I took guard in the camouflaged bunker just outside the draw bridge. Had I had it my way, I wouldn't have been there at all. At the least maybe they could've paired me off with one of the other guards. Instead, they sent me, a narcoleptic armed guard, to stand watch for any impending attacks. Not the brightest of ideas, but then again, a lack of intelligence was the reason for my kingdom finding itself in this position in the first place. Fully aware once again, I heard the guard bellow from the tower for a second time. ""All is lost!"" he screamed. ""The enemy is through the gate!""

I knew that the main gate of the castle wasn't open, I just didn't know just how long the others would be out there waiting to get help. So, I put the group in a small, cramped cell of the castle and told them that they needed to make as much noise as they could while going forward, in hopes that someone would be coming from above to help. That's when it became obvious that things were really changing for me, I was no longer the strong, stern, badass girl I used to be.

He was a Stanford Law School dropout before he found his calling with the CIA.

Vanity Fair columnist Robert Draper described Huntington as ""[a] brilliant orator, a smart and worldly intellectual, but [now] a brilliant orator with a new message.""

This is a real problem for anyone who is gay in America. And it's a problem that you probably haven't even thought about.

This year, at the height of the legalization of gay marriage in all fifty states, a poll found that a whopping 75% of young Americans believe that homosexuality should be illegal if it is against their religious beliefs. The same poll found that a full 52% of them think that homosexuality should be legally defined as a sin.

Now it's a well-known fact that most atheists and humanists will agree that homosexuality should be made illegal because it is a violation of every major aspect of human decency.

Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once.

One of the most popular books of 2011 was Dan Ariely's now-classic, How To Live Well In The World Without Having Everything You Want. What a lot of people don't know about Ariely is that he's a serial entrepreneur. He cofounded the online research site Predictably Irrational on a $500,000 investment. He launched a business, The Decision Economics Group, to teach his theories. Later, he founded a company that turned to science for help with its technology.

He could remember the way it felt, the sound, and the look of the instrument, but in the end he could not say for certain that he had witnessed the pianist play the notes that the camera showed.

However, it does not contradict any of the other observations made throughout the film.

Analysis

In these cases, the filmmakers chose a scene where the piano was present and made an argument that it was part of a ritual. This is supported by the fact that they did not produce any of the other audio, such as chanting or playing of musical instruments.

In the case of The Sound and the Fury, a second scene in which the piano was still present was edited later in the movie for reasons that would not be made clear until the next movie.

The difference between these occurrences and The Sound and the Fury is very interesting","[ IP ] Piano of the forest Whether or not the piano was actually real was something that he could not say for certain .

"[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice. What you're doing here is","[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the old Brain-Slice series, while having a more futuristic look. With the same basic idea but with some new ideas. Like the robots from earlier, it also shows the world of the future by showing the world's development through a single individual. This one was very fun to draw and I'm definitely going to keep it on my watchlist as I do a lot of science fiction related works.

This year's Echo is all about the robots! I wanted to make sure that the robots were strong and were able to work as a unit. These are all robots that have been given a life to enjoy.

"How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, ""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end."" This essay serves that purpose for this section. Please note that not every person has the capacity to write with both hands or with both eyes simultaneously. However, it can be done and it is certainly something worthwhile to try.

If you don't have a keyboard, that option should be available at your favorite bookstore or from your local library before making any other major decisions about starting your writing. Don't take my word for it; take the word of that brilliant woman in my life: Mary Ann Moakley. Her blog posts explain perfectly how you can do this and show you many good articles on this topic on other sites that will interest you.

One of the things you'll notice right off is that you don't have to use any type of writing tool whatsoever. The fact that you can write in anything but a typewriter","How do I start ?

In Naruto, Hagoromo is shown to be able to summon a swarm of poisonous butterflies that can take out entire groups of opponents, and the Kyuubi's true form. In the first anime, Hagoromo was even able to teleport directly to where the Kyuubi is waiting with his butterfly swarm.

Hagoromo in the Bleach anime is also seen being able to use shapeshifting, and even to transform his body into a full-body cloak. Using this, he can take on the forms of several other shinobi at once, allowing him to blend in with his surroundings.

The story is incredibly well told. The narrator gives a great voice to the characters and adds to their struggles. The main narrative is very well paced, but there is a lot of side plots as well and is not one dimensional. It can be difficult at times when a character is in a difficult situation, that can be very hard to follow at times, but the story gets better as you keep reading.

Only problem is that she is in a coma and they have no clue when she will wake up. Jane Doe -- no one knows what her real name is. She was in a horrible car accident and she had no identification of who she is with her when she was in the accident. Now she's in a coma and I'm her doctor. I knew she was my soulmate from the second I laid my eyes on her. The rumor is that when you meet your soulmate you know right away that they are the one. But how do you know? What are you supposed to feel? I felt alive. For the first time in my life I felt like I had a purpose to be alive and she is it. All I wanted to do was move her hair out of her eyes and kiss her.

A doctor has just found that new loved one and you feel like a total jerk for getting their mail, or for looking only at their Facebook, or for being so uninterested in the person that made you mad. We think we know what is happening but we really don't know what's up, or have any idea how to stop it, or to even love in the first place. So how do we stop and love, love and stop, then love again?

In the world of love, what we think are things are actually completely opposite of what is actually happening when we meet someone. Not only do we have to learn not to hate (or fear or love) people, not only do we have to learn to fall in love again, but we also have to recognize how different our ideas and behaviors were when we were our romantic selves when we met our",Everybody has one soulmate that they are destined to end up with and you know who it is the moment you see them .

"You wake up in Prison, how do you fare? I'm shocked as I take in my surroundings. I'm wearing an orange jumpsuit, am surrounded by bars, the walls are white concrete. So, this is prison. I don't know how I ended up here or why, but I will. A guard rattles his club on the door and informs me that its time for breakfast. I exit my cell and join the orange stream moving to the dining area. One of the first things I notice here is the cutting glances of hate thrown my way. Perhaps it's because I'm new.

Modern nations dissolve and new countries rise in their place divided by the preferred music. In the frozen north, people are driven to extinction by the ice and snow for their resistance to the ice. In the south, a magical band, in collusion with the King, summons ice magic.

A few decades after the ice age, the King sends an expedition group of adventurers up to the very top of one of the ice mountains. The expedition never returns. The rest of the world is frozen.

The expedition leader is Captain John Carter of the expedition party, a self-interested mercenary. His fellow expedition members include two women scientists, a young woman of the North Kingdom, and a woman from the South Kingdom searching to take over her kingdom. After all is said and done, he discovers that the expedition made a crucial discovery: ice magic still works and the frozen world is beginning back to life.

Gain gold by creating dragon creatures and placing them in their respective areas. Be creative as you place different types of dragons in different areas, just keep them under the normal amount.


Once you find a treasure, create five other dragons and place them in the same spots. Once four of the five dragons are done, place five gems in their respective areas. Once five are placed within a group, a portal for the dragon group should appear. Once all the treasure is out, head to dragon group 1 and repeat until done.


Once you have done the entire area, the goal will be complete.

As we know, this was not our first attempt at getting away from the rules set by the game's creators and we had plenty of trouble in order to do so. The game had been out almost a year before our trip and we decided to have the entire company on board as well as several of their community managers; the goal being to get all of our teams on board for the project. Our main goal was to get the whole company together, which was something I found to be quite the task considering that only a handful of people were from the whole company at the time.

When I received a call from our CEO two weeks before the trip, I thought that","A strange virus of pandemic proportions kills close to ninety five percent of the world 's population .

Darkseid is my favorite superhero, and I would be a fool not to play him, but the villain I play might be more like Captain America.

This seems like a reasonable premise. Who could blame them? After all, if the original pilot was revived 30 years later, the original crew might have wanted to know where they were, what happened, and why.

They wouldn't know any of that if they hadn't been sent back to retrieve their ship...and their crew.

What happens next is just a question of time travel paradoxes. The original crew, having been revived, find themselves in the future where the crew hasn't been rescued by the time travelling fleet. They try to return to Earth, and get into trouble.

There was no excuse for including such a generic, bland statement into the article title. The headline could have been ""In the Beginning was The Creation Story...

"Adolf Hitler gets accepted into Art school. Absolute chaos. The world is in absolute chaos. It is the end of the world as we know it. The Final War. Russia could no longer contain the army it created. The Soviets became a supreme world power and we did not bat an eye as they experimented heavily on humans. Over time, they were able to build the Russian Supersoldier. At first, the Supersoldiers conquered. The Soviet Union and the rest of Europe went to war, in which was initially called World War 2. Within days, Germany was wiped out, nearly every citizen killed. Within weeks, France was conquered and within two months, Britain was taken. Russia soon took over the Americas by the end of the year. However, it did not stop there. The problem was a bacteria that came to be known as the Supersoldier Virus.

But while the art world reacted with dismay to the cancellation of Hitler's show, the artist in question defended himself in the Guardian.

""Of course,"" he added, ""I cannot claim that my work is devoid of political meaning. It is one of many forms of art expressing a political argument, to which I can only respond with the question: why is the argument so bad?""

When asked if the artist felt he had been discriminated against, he said: ""In Germany, when you do art",Adolf Hitler gets accepted into Art school . Absolute chaos . The world is in absolute chaos .

What is a story-game and what does it entail?

A story-game is a video game that is primarily designed to teach and inspire you in some way, as well as to stimulate your imagination, and to entertain you.

Story-games do everything from providing you a challenging game as a learning tool to providing for you an enjoyable challenge that has a great amount of replay value. The most fun I was having was the ""War"" game and the ""Chrono Trigger"" game. Each of those games have multiple ways to win (even if just by being faster, you can go back to the era before the timeline you fought in) and provide for an outstanding learning experience.

The day is also the first time an SS officer walks into the camp. Once they're in, the first act is to beat up a Jewish woman by shooting her in the face, killing her. Once a Jewish woman is dead, everyone in the camp will be shot.

The next morning, they shoot a German guard.

I grew up in a town just outside a fairly small city, I was privileged to go to one of the best schools in the country, for a small school it produced a huge percentage of professional athletes, world renowned scientists and political leaders. I spent those years drinking beers with my friends and having loads of fun. I got average grades and then went to the same college as most of my friends. I spent most of the time there drinking (legally for the first time) and having probably even more fun than when I was in school.

A single lamp provides a red light only if the driver presses a button at the back of the bus or even at full speed. If I saw this when I was 18 I'd have panicked that every other driver did too so I'd have been lucky enough to avoid paying a fine - or worse. Now I know that the idea is far too expensive for regular use - a £100 ""safety lamp"" could probably be bought on the black market for about 100p. Most of us live less than a mile from a school. The ""safety lamp"" will be a welcome relief to drivers at the end",You live in a world where every person receives a superpower on their 18th birthday .

It's subtle tongue made the sound for me alone, for it was I who longed for the wondrous being of which the name gave life. Her name. Lenore.

It must have been some years since I had been abroad; I had never passed through the gates here, and then it struck me that this place ought not to lie in the same category as the other old houses of the village; some must be left behind for evermore, and this one had all the telltale scars of a visit from another time, and was an ugly and dilapidated ruin.

The survivors, who are a bit like the inhabitants of a horror movie, are led by a charismatic leader who leads them into a series of intense combat missions. The group then moves on to bigger and better things, with some major, dramatic stakes at the end.

Unfortunately, the gameplay (which at the time was set in a dark, low-key industrial area of New York) and general presentation didn't quite live up to the movie's tone.

Picking up where AdventureQuest 3D left off, players will encounter and defeat a variety of new creatures that join forces with Death. But the most interesting new addition to this new campaign will be a character called the Shadow Dragon King.

The Shadow Dragon King

Even though it sounds quite similar to AdventureQuest 3D's Shadow Dragons, there are important differences among them.

The player will have to fight the Shadow Dragon King alone while taking on new, harder monsters.

A character and a world will not be able to defeat Death, but they may stand against him and take his place.

Death won't be alone in this adventure.","To keep up with challenges by mortals , Death must master every new game that comes up . But there 's one game that he just ca n't figure out ....

The AI will then learn the rules of the internet through the site and learn to play against humans on a simulated version of Chess.

The chess AI, called DeepMind, has been built to understand the rules of a board game that humans cannot, like Chess.

If a human and machine face off, it will always win. But DeepMind will have to find the best strategy to beat human beings, as there are millions of possibilities.

Its AI has been trained to play against human opponents at a tournament.

""DeepMind's work on chess may one day mean that we will be able to train our computer systems to beat us at chess,"" says DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis.

My experience with the show can be summed up in a single sentence. I had a dream about myself in a past life. I can't really say more because of all the spoilers, but it was a story-driven and supernatural tale, with elements of the fantastical.

At least I thought it was a good idea. However I've lost all my friends and family, winning lottery tickets, a freak fall, run over by a wild boar, and my boyfriend, the love of all my lives, was taken by a sewing pin.

So why does it get better? Because when someone dies, that person continues on and is reborn in another city, new clothes, a new family, and the whole works.

Beauty is achieved gradually through good thoughts and deeds, while the opposite is true in the realm of material appearance. A person may appear flawless at birth due to his or her superior education, wealth, good deeds, or great physical beauty. However, no change can be made on the basis of appearance.

However, it is possible to alter an individual's appearance when a person's physical appearance is unsatisfactory. This alteration can take the form of a tattoo, skin disease, or a deformity. One can even take the appearance of a monster, for example by drawing on one's face, or even becoming a monster oneself.

After acquiring such a deformity, one can assume the appearance of a beast which can be used to avoid the authorities and to evade detection. By changing one's physical appearance at will, it may be possible for one to escape detection or for someone to steal your body.","In this world , physical appearance depends entirely on personality .

Most of this tattoo has meaning, but not everyone has the same, and it's always the tattoos with meaning that remain with you.

These are the tattoos of the gods, the heroes, the villains and the weirdos.

And although all of these are unique, they have no value except as a testimony to the person and time. These are the tattoos that no one can deny and leave them alone.

As long as you live to see someone else grow out of these things, they always have that value.

Yusuf. Not only is he a friend but he also has an even better personality and sense of self than I do.

Hogwarts' new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher is John Constantine. *Haven't read the original source material yet so I'm basing this off the character from the TV show* It had been a long time since anything of any real significance had happened at Hogwarts. Things went more smoothly and the school was.... a school and things had to carry on.

But even as things changed they remained the same; somehow the tradition of the notoriously short tenure of its professors had endured. But this year was a bit different.

When someone dies, there are dozens of people they talk to: one tells them what happened to them, one explains why they lost their life, one makes a recommendation as to how to live their life better. Some are more educated, while others are less so. Some come to the Grim Reaper because of a particular tragedy. Many Grim Reapers have had no prior interaction with someone who has died. They're just given a simple list of basic questions, which they then follow with a recommendation. For most, the death of a loved one or spouse is a wake-up call.

What does a death have to do with God and religion? The New Testament refers to death as the penalty for sin – sin, not eternal suffering – while the Gospels refer to death as a punishment for a personal evil, like theft or adultery. Yet, in the West we call an individual who has died ""dead"". In Latin funerals are referred to as ""","There is no singular Grim Reaper .

"Jesus came back in 1996. He has spent the last 20 years locked in an asylum trying to convince his doctors that he is the real deal. Finally after all this time he is beginning to change their minds. The doctor strode into his office, a calm, complete stride that he had adopted working in the mental facility. No physical uncertainty translated to no mental uncertainty - and he needed that kind of protection working with the patients. After thumbing through his strictly organized file cabinet and removing a crisp manila folder, the wizened doctor lowered himself into his office chair and swung to face the man seated in front of him. The best way he could be described is paradoxical - While his body was stringy and lean, his eyes conveyed deep strength and determination. Determination, it was evident, to get out. ""Jesus"" the doctor drawled, his impatience lining his face. ""You must understand. I can not legally release you until you've proven to Ms. Sarah""","Jesus came back in 1996.

So says the Daily Mail this morning on what was billed as the most alarming development of the month. What about a parallel, unannounced project of world-wide, simultaneous, mind control by 'The Cabal'. And how do you convince the masses that their 'right-thinking' leaders' don't know what they are doing?

As of the time of writing, it appears that these'mind control' projects are a joint venture between the Illuminati and the Global Elite. Is there any danger this will be mischaracterized as just another case of 'conspiracy theories'. Can anything be done to prevent these 'psychic' projects from getting out of control?

"Instead of killing him, a timetraveller tells Hitler how future generations will remember him. In the original history it was Hitler that won the war but in a much quicker and cleaner fashion. Hitler's blitzkrieg originally took Belgium and France too quickly and his u-boats were able to starve out the British out of supplies by practicing unrestricted naval warfare from the beginning. This allowed him to turn the full might of the German military to take out Russia before they were prepared and by mobilizing early enough they took Moscow before the Russian winter set. This effectively rendered Europe under German control. Years later the world would belong to Germany after a period of consolidating the assets of Europe to enhance the war machine. We sought to change that history and we needed to take drastic measures. Originally we believed that we could just send someone to kill him, but every attempt failed.

He is presented as not just the smartest, most rational person in history but also the best and the only one. As a result of this he is not just the only person to take his decisions but the only person to be able to make them.


The fact that Hitler has taken so much decision so quickly and in such a way to turn things around has resulted in the fact that he is now, at the end of the war, the most despised man in Germany (although we see no evidence of that).

As the United Nations recently put it, ""Every country should strive for a national health system that protects life and care for the weak and vulnerable, assures quality and access to health services, and promotes sustainable development.""

In the United States, the only countries to have adopted national health systems without significant reform were Australia in the 1970s and Japan in the 1990s.

However, the United States has had national health systems in place for more than three decades, since Medicare and Medicaid were introduced in 1965 and 1973 respectively.

These two programs constitute the foundation of a nation's health care system. They have been credited with reducing the number of uninsured and improving access to health services for millions of people, especially minorities and low-income Americans.

History Edit

Atrocitus is from the planet Glimmerpoint and is the main antagonist in Glimmerpoint Odyssey, where he is voiced by Chris Sarandon in the role of the main antagonist (sending the other main characters out of his way to aid him). He is the leader of a group of pirates and their home is the Citadel of Fire. The majority of his crew are ex-Galaxy warriors. He uses several weapons including a large machine gun, a large cannon that can be mounted to his back, a rocket launcher mounted under his shield that he calls a BFG, and a massive beam that can shoot out from his back. Atrocitus is","Despite being peaceful , humans are universally feared through out the galaxy as harbingers of death . They are hosts to the most dangerous diseases and bacteria ever discovered .

At 12:00pm EST, a single person in the world would drop dead from no discernible cause. The technology behind it was complex, a new order of probability theory made reality. Tyrants and terrorists were the first to go. The hope remained even among the growing horror that maybe, just maybe, the world would show its good side. Its collective benevolence.

So let me ask you, as a Christian: if all humanity is condemned to be killed in our world, and it seems we are going to keep it that way indefinitely, what will the purpose of God be if there is a future for humankind, if there is some hope for salvation? What will that be if we have all the evils, if there is not any opportunity for redemption?

In the beginning, friends and family thought it was a joke. The doctors thought me a liar. There was no possible scientific explanation for a disease that would make one dance, of all things, whenever music was heard. It just made no sense. But when we discovered that it was contagious, that I spread the disease wherever I went, the doctors started studying me seriously. Still, at the time it was still just a passing curiosity, and no hindrance to everyday life. The unease began when it turned out that the spread of the disease started to accelerate. The doctors, through careful experimentation, discovered that the disease had a delayed onset upon exposure. That countless many may have caught the disease without displaying the symptoms became","Follow-up: You are a compulsive dancer. Anywhere there is music playing you struggle to remain still. The disease began with me. As a teenager I learned to relax by dancing to music. Then over the time it affected the rest of my life. I've learned to relax with the help of music (and by the help of physical therapists, chiropractors, massage therapists, etc.). I am aware of how it has affected my life and I am trying to take my life back. You should know who is responsible. It's not a matter of whether the dancers involved have a problem, but who is the responsible party and what is the cure,"" he added.

In July, The Times (UK) newspaper reported that the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), the censor board in India, had asked its officials to ""get with the times"" as they felt the public did not take the matter much serious.

"The Town Parade Committee has grown far too powerful. It's up to you to stop them. No one remembers exactly how the thing got so big. Of course, I'm talking about the 4th of July Parade. It started out just like you'd expect, an hour of floats, men in silly hats driving tiny cars, local businesses throwing candy, that sort of thing. There were speeches from the local politicians, picnics, you know. Being a small town, everyone had a good time. But somehow it got bigger. Longer. More floats. More trucks for businesses (some with strange names that no one had ever heard of,) their beds full of the King and Queen of every concept imaginable. More clowns, more funny cars, and worst of all - more Parade Officials. The first year it happened, the Parade went on for hours. The Officials knocked on doors, suggesting that everyone should come watch. Most did. Some didn't. A few never showed up again. But the Parade was over, we all went home and went","The Town Parade Committee has grown far too powerful. It's up to you to stop them. No one remembers exactly how the thing got so big. But the Town's leaders have used the time between the War to gather more power for the parade committee. Things have gotten so out of hand, this is a question for Mayor Edwina Johnson, the City Council and the School Committee. But the City Council needs to take immediate action to reevaluate the Town's ""Town-wide Planning Committee."" There hasn't been a single town meeting since the election in February. The Town's leaders now make decisions about how to spend taxpayer money based on their personal relationships. Why should the residents of the Town know about what their leaders choose to do with their tax dollars? There must be some democratic accountability for the Town to follow-up on their plans. The Mayor should be accountable to the people. The current rules are not working. The Town needs to bring it together.

For most of the last 10 0 years, the parade has drawn crowds of every kind. Young, old, children, people of all colors. Everyone in town can agree that it has become too big.

I asked, without a word the smugler went into a small house and made I sign for me to follow him, there was nothing in there but a big tank, How do I know you are not scamming me? I asked, the answer came from seemingly no where and was as I expected, You dont, but you have no choice isnt it correct? I could smell god forsaken ocean above us, the salt and the water vapor followef you every where you went. With a quick trust of my hand I threw the money on the ground, Nice doing business with ya', was the all he said back to me.

A major disaster has led to a worldwide migration of people to the bottom of the world. The first major human expansion of the oceans happened sometime in the 5th millennium.

"[ CC ] [ PI ] C764 ~ would really appreciate some crit for this piece. I find it a bit difficult to envision the setting. I know it's complicated, but my brain just isn't putting together a good image of what it looks like. It seems like, later in the story, you're describing structures, which doesn't jibe with the concept of cages in my mind. Also, where did the building materials come from? I'm also a bit spotty on the concept of Guilds. What are they? Where did they come from? How many are there? Is everyone in a Guild, or only some people? Do Guilds define the social structure of the caged society? The Shadow is mentioned at the beginning, but kind of falls away after that. Was this intentional, indicating the people are left to their own devices? Maybe you could work the Shadow into a","[ CC ] [ PI ] C764 ~ would really appreciate some crit for this piece. I find it a bit difficult to envision the setting. It does have that nice, crisp color and composition, but the colors are way too saturated in general. It might make your work, but it's not like a very vivid piece. Still, it's worth a shot.

I did this one and I do like it. I think it would make a cool background for your pieces. I think it should've been a smidge larger. And the colors are very bold and you could have made something far more bold. Maybe just a bit lighter. Definitely not dark. It really looks like an old movie! Great job!
