The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained. Matica hrvatska and Matica srpska were to work together on a dictionary, and a committee of Serbian and Croatian linguists was asked to prepare a pravopis.

The occasion also contained an international conference on Slavic literature in France. During the conference there were many discussions on the ways in which the Serbian and Croatian literary traditions could serve as a bridge for the European literary project. The most significant among them was the conference held on 14-15th January 1959, in Paris between Srdja Trifunovic, the literary critic and leader of the Slovene Renaissance, and Jadranka Lajeva (later president-designate of the Council of Europe).

The Slovene Renaissance was a political movement and it took an active part in the formation of a new Slovenia. It was strongly in favour of the ""cultural autonomy"" of Slovenia, its independence from central authority.","In 1954 , major Serbian and Croatian writers , linguists and literary critics , backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement , which in its preamble stated that `` The Serbian and Croatian literary languages are equal and should be made equal in their use , and be developed equally .

Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force.

"An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in.

The spire was one of the four Gothic arch-spires in use during the Middle Ages. The spire, while important in relation to its artistic style, was also important to its construction. It allowed the designers to incorporate a dome and bell towers from a single structure rather than having to incorporate them separately.

"Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies","Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. This variation between populations and species is one of the primary means of differentiation among mammals.

Such a hair appears on the face of one or both sides of the upper lip, under the chin, and is arranged in a ring around the eyes. The hairs are dark in color and are usually small. A few mammals such as the rhesus macaque, an important research model, have very few hair follicles on one side of the face, the eyebrows.

"Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from","Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the immune system (Jasanoff, 1975), and this system has an important impact on many diseases of the brain.

This study highlights the importance of emotion and social interaction in stress responses. Emotions are fundamental to biological processes and therefore may influence stress responses. In this context, several of the studies, including stress responses and inflammation in social interactions, showed that these effects were specific to socially stressful situations. It is likely that similar results occur in other types of stress response, such as those in the face of the financial crisis. Thus, the idea of emotional regulation and the effects of social interactions on stress response and inflammation might be modified.

To our knowledge, most of the studies investigating acute social stress responses have studied the stress response after a few days or weeks. Many of the studies showed an association between acute social stress","Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology , particularly with the stress systems . This is important because emotions are related to brain responses and activity . The relationship between stress and emotions becomes especially relevant when applied to human brain activity and the central nervous system . Emotional experiences are mediated by a group of brain regions , the limbic system , which include the hippocampus and amygdala . The limbic system is responsible for the regulation of mood , the processing of emotional states , and the formation of basic drives . When an individual perceives a situation as a threat , the stress system prepares the body to deal with the danger by mobilizing energy stores and by activating the sympathetic nervous system . This activates the adrenal glands and stimulates the liver to release the hormone cortisol , causing an increase in heart rate .

The fight - flight - freeze response can involve the central nervous system ( CNS ) as well as the autonomic and endocrine systems during stressful situations that require coping .",10.39

"Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper ""Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races"". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population.

Therefore, the number of genetic variants available for selection should correspond to a fixed population size.

He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated ""favoured races"" as ""perfected races"", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack.

The best translation of the book ever was done by a Frenchman, M. De l'Amiral, who began English translations in the years after Darwin's death.

But, while we can affirm Kant's conviction, we cannot accept the thesis that this human nature contains nothing more than ideas.

In addition to their disagreements in methodology and content, the two German Idealists disagreed in the nature of their ethical philosophy.

Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Starčevo-Körös (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vinča. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC. The Vinča culture may have created the earliest system of writing, the Vinča signs, though archaeologist Shan Winn believes they most likely represented pictograms and ideograms rather than a truly developed form of writing.

However, for most of recorded history, agriculture and foraging were inter-twined, in a way that still applies today, which is one of the main reasons why there have been significant and mutually beneficial relationships between modern humans and traditional (and sometimes even semi-modern) societies in general. A simple example of this is that of the domestication of plants, the introduction of cattle, and later the establishment of grain-based economies. In fact, early farmers and herders have been seen as the primary ancestors of our modern agricultural communities and in many cases have in fact become some of our most important predecessors in terms of cultural innovation and technological achievement.

A royal commission was established to monitor the activities of foreign merchants (1556) and by the end of the century French interests in the Netherlands had shrunk to a minimum (1568), even as French power spread into the lowlands of Europe (1627).

The most important of these changes was the development of the French empire from the 16th to the 19th century, and the end of the Renaissance. The reign of Charles VI (1610–14), which saw a series of civil wars and major rebellions, culminated in an unprecedented defeat by the forces of the Holy Roman Empire in 1648.

"Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow","Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals.

"Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years.

But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status.

Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience.

It is not known exactly how the injection is performed, but when one injects the epinephrine it is absorbed into the blood as normal. However, when the epinephrine is taken out of the body it is converted into a powerful vasoconstrictor. This is caused by the increased presence of ""pH"" ions.

"Hong Taiji's bureaucracy was staffed with many Han Chinese, including many newly surrendered Ming officials. The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong.

The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an arrangement called the Qing 'Dynastic Government,' a complex arrangement that had been put into effect by the Manchu emperors before the Qing took power, and which permitted the Manchukuo government to remain autonomous and self-sufficient.

In the middle of the 19th century, the Qing state was a major player in the diplomatic history of China. It was forced to seek alliances with more regional powers, and in particular with the European powers of the time, and it worked at maintaining cordial relations with Britain and France. These relations were based on the fact that both France and Britain were allied with France's Tsar, Russia, and Tsarina Aleksandra. France considered Russia to be a useful trading partner, and the Qing was eager to do more business with Europe, particularly since, as British foreign policy in the Empire began","Hong Taiji 's bureaucracy was staffed with many Han Chinese , including many newly surrendered Ming officials .

"Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The","Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these founder events probably represent, at best, a very small subset of all the Jews. If they did represent a larger fraction (by 50%) of all the Jews, the most ancient Jewish ancestors likely began to appear about 10,000 years ago in Africa, with a substantial fraction of the Jewish gene pool coming from about 100,000 years ago (see Figure 1). This is somewhat less than the age of the first Jewish men from sub-Saharan Africa, so the evidence does not support the picture of a new migration from Africa to Europe and back. However, the new results add to the evidence for an ancient Jewish migration, and they help to eliminate the possibility that the most ancient Jews were a people who began their spread and admixture around the time of the Exodus (12,500 years ago).

In conclusion, the new work shows that","Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths . In most Jewish populations , these founding mutations have been found to be rare , and there is no evidence of any founder effect in their genetic evolution . In some populations a single founding mutation has been observed . A famous example is the Cohen Modal Haplotype ( 3 / 12 , 15 / 151 , 10 / 17 , 11/27 ) which is shared by 38 %. We did not find any signatures of rare founding mutations for one of our founding haplotype types ( Table 2 ) . This suggests that founders of the Yemenite Jewish population contributed with the same proportions among the three main haplogroups , T2 , T1 , and A1 . The main founder effect was probably exerted by the original haplogroup T which entered Yemen , giving origin to Yemenite Jews , and this affected all haplogroup s to some degree . It is more likely that the haplogroup T originated in Africa .",9.57

The state was able to survive through the Reform War with support from many nobles. It was a time of a rapid economic growth in the province.

The Reform War and the Civil War years

The Reform War broke out in 1840. A popular uprising was planned to retake Ayutla where the governor remained in exile on St. Dominic's Island (later renamed Capitula de la Patria), which lies in the Gulf of Punta Cana. After the failure of this revolt, military power began to rise in the region. The French military defeated the uprising after a bloody struggle. After the French victory, the Republic held a referendum that called on all citizens to vote in favor of independence in October 1851. French colonial rule in Ayutla ended that afternoon (November 11th) and the first government was elected on January 1st, 1852.

"In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose ""anything but intercourse"" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21. Multrine also states in her article","In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse, isolation) and sexual promiscuity, are often overcome by social and psychological supports, adolescents exposed to abuse by parents, siblings, a babysitter or a peer are more likely to become victimizers themselves to avoid the consequences of having been abused. This includes suicide or attempting suicide (13) and is a potential focus for prevention efforts in communities.

While many of us might think that adolescents are a risk group for substance abuse, more than 2.8 million of us have an alcohol use disorder, the vast majority of whom are in their late teens (10)–young adults (14). More than 500,000 adolescent females have an eating disorder and as much as 200,000 adolescent females are diagnosed as clinically depressed (15–17) despite the fact that only 10% of all teenagers are currently receiving treatment for depression (18).","In contemporary society , adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform .

There are several mental risks that adolescents face . One of them is emotional distress , which is simply putting oneself in a state of fear or distress that would result from any sexual act . Whether it is emotional distress as a result of a lack of sexual knowledge , or from a sexual relationship with someone who is very different from you , it is a major risk for adolescents . There is also an important risk related to sexual abuse . At this age , the person is usually just as defenseless on an emotional level as on an intellectual level , and so if a victim of sexual abuse is aware of this fact , he or she can become overwhelmed very easily .

"The deeper ancestral demography of Bermuda's population has been obscured by the ethnic homogenisation of the last four centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico.

In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult.

"Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae","Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of ammonia.


Many vertebrates, such as salamanders, lagomorphs - a group of extinct mammals - have no uric acids. Instead their high uric acid content is taken up in a form similar to urea, used to produce urea which then converts to urochromes and urea-glucuronide. So a carnivore (or other obligate carnivore, since that usually relies on blood to survive) will always have a high concentration of urea-based proteins even if it has no uric acid.


In birds, the most common uric acid is chystrale, which is found in about 80 and 75 percent of the birds tested. The other uric acid is uric acid, which is made by birds at an even higher concentration.

","Like the reptiles , birds are primarily uricotelic , that is , their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia . This results in the formation of a white paste known as urates , instead of the usual urine that humans produce . Because uric acid is much less soluble than urea or ammonia , birds do not have the same challenges with urinary concentrations that humans are familiar with . Rather , uric acid is excreted as a white paste that requires virtually no water to leave the body , which makes sense considering that water is somewhat of a scarcity in an arid environment . This also has the benefit of not concentrating urine which may prevent kidney damage . Birds can not , however , concentrate the urine to help them regulate the ionic composition of their blood .

"As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily influenced by his father. He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. Schwarzenegger has responded to a question asking if he was 13 when he started weightlifting: ""I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting.""

In the 1960s, Transport for London (TfL) assumed responsibility for building the motorways.

"Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and immunity. Therefore, civil and religious law limited the number and kind of religious offices allowed an individual and his family. Religious law was collegial and traditional; it informed political decisions, could overturn them, and was difficult to exploit for personal gain. Priesthood was a costly honour: in traditional Roman practice, a priest drew no stipend. Cult donations were the property of the deity, whose priest must provide cult regardless of shortfalls in public funding – this could mean subsidy of acolytes and all other cult maintenance from personal funds. For those who had reached their goal in the Cursus honorum, permanent priesthood was best sought or granted after a lifetime's service in military or political life, or preferably both: it was a particularly honourable and active form of retirement which","Public priests were appointed by the collegia. Once elected, a priest held permanent religious authority from the eternal divine, which offered him lifetime influence, privilege and power.

Pope Gregory, in one of his letters, wrote that the pope was the most powerful man in Christendom. In 1512 Pope Leo X ordered all bishops and monks to receive some of his priests. They would then be allowed to wear their clerical vestments, wear a papal tiara and take part in the liturgical services. In addition the Pope had appointed a ""secretariat of the pope"" at the Roman College of Cardinals.

The first Pope Gregory died on 30 May 1514 at the age of 47. His only daughter Elisabeth died the following year in the same year. All the rest of their children survived their father.

"When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone","When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of the other consoles and thus the NES was visually different from the other consoles, even when it was meant for one common machine.

The Sega Master System and Mega Drive were made in Japan while the 16-bit consoles were made in America. However, due to the fact that this was not technically feasible the Master System was manufactured with just one core. The Mega Drive also had two cores per module, although for some unknown reasons there were three instead of four.

This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: ""river"". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE).

Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators. Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog.

"From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as ""put-ons"". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons.","From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and calculate the motion of all the world's particles according to a complex mathematical formula. At first, Feynman never succeeded in the precise calculations he needed to prove his theorem to the satisfaction of his advisor, who found that they needed quite a lot of work. Then, in 1953, Feynman had an extraordinary realization: that he could solve this problem as completely as possible while in the midst of doing experiments—because of his mathematical ideas about interactions and field theory.

Fearing the public reaction of those not willing to believe him at first, despite his excellent mathematical calculations, Feynman turned to the world to try and convince them. He wrote one paper for the physics journal Nature before he was accepted to graduate school. He published his work, in 1958, in two publications: ""On the Characteristics of the Universe,","From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime , Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the forces they could wield and the interactions they would instigate , and thus predict the behavior of large objects in larger systems . Thus a very good book for those who are just starting off the quantum mechanics journey is Pauling 's General Chemistry . A good overview for understanding elementary particles , forces and interactions . Bohr and his Copenhagen Interpretation gave the view of quantum physics that most practitioners have used , and to some extent still do . 5- The Rise of Field Theories . The most elegant approach to quantum mechanics is to treat the particles in the quantum system , however small or large , as excitations of an underlying field which permeates all of space . The field may be either a massless scalar field , a massive scalar or a vector . Massive scalar fields can not be treated as classical fields , but scalar quantum fields are a more familiar concept , and are treated as a continuous classical field . Although some classical field models have been very successful , it is usually difficult to get the theory into agreement with experiment .",11.17
"In late 1203, John attempted to relieve Château Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany in an attempt to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.[nb 8] John's situation began to deteriorate rapidly.

John's forces besieged the castle, which they did under heavy artillery fire, and on June 6, 1203, Château Gaillard was captured and abandoned.

John's capture of Château Gaillard was widely reported in the English countryside. The English countryside was so consumed with war that the local media rarely reported news of any other topics (such as the death of John's sons and the burning of the castle). Château Gaillard was soon joined by its sister castle, Château de la Croix, to form a defensive network. John had been a member of a long line of English kings, but was forced to flee from the English court following the death of his brother, Henry II, in December 1099.

To make the situation even more complicated and ironic , John 's primary target , the French city of Rouen , which was controlled by Philip , stood on the eastern shore of the Seine River , directly across from Château Gaillard , which gave John the advantage. John had been warned that Philip was planning to seize or sack Dieulacres Abbey ( and hence its lands ) for the sole purpose of securing an extravagant marriage to John 's widowed Queen Isabel. It was also revealed that the Abbot of Dieulacres Abbey was none other than the Bishop of Rouen , one of the most powerful clerics of the land . < /s >.",7.44
"In 2013, however, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions, again corroborating the pre-2006 origin hypothesis. Testing was performed on the full 16,600 DNA units composing mitochondrial DNA (the 2006 Behar study had only tested 1,000 units) in all their subjects, and the study found that the four main female Ashkenazi founders had descent lines that were established in Europe 10,000 to 20,000 years in the past while most of the remaining minor founders also have a deep European ancestry. The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins. Richards summarized the findings on the female line as such: ""[N]one [of the mtDNA] came from the","In 2013, however, a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield, U.K., found that this paternal line had been lost within 20 generations. In this paper, Richards et al. note that some groups that now seem to have a substantial number of African origins, have a very small Middle Eastern ancestry. Some groups, including many of the Ashkenazim, appear to have undergone a considerable number of admixture events with neighboring Arab tribes, but this should not result in a genetic bottleneck as a result of such long-distance admixture.

""The overall situation for the Ashkenazi appears to be much more complex than it was 20 years ago, and we find it hard to understand why this complex pattern started at a level it has gone to at present,"" Richards says. ""This kind of complex pattern suggests some underlying processes may be at work for which we are yet to understand very well.""","In 2013 , however , a study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA by a team led by Martin B. Richards of the University of Huddersfield in England reached different conclusions , claiming that the mitochondrial lineages in 748 test subjects indicated that in most cases Ashkenazi Jews had a more widespread European heritage , not one based only in Eastern Europe . Richards said that the study showed that while 33 to 37 % of the haplotypes of Ashkenazi Jews are of Eastern European origin , 59 to 63 % had Western European origins . A later study of 102 Ashkenazi families in 2015 found that 88 % had at least one ancestor from either Central or Eastern Europe , while 16 % of 2 n d - degree ancestors were.

As a consequence of the success of its exhibitions, Cubiste was invited to a number of exhibitions around the world, often in its own exhibition ""Le Cubiste"". The exhibition took place between February and November on the occasion of the centennial of the Birth of Art and its influence on modern architecture. This was the first time that a European architect was allowed to go so far as to present his own architecture. It became widely known as the first true global gathering of modernism and art.

It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A ""Draft Eisenhower"" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time.

Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and self-esteem and how others perceive those concepts and feels about oneself. While a person's self-concept is important in defining one's identity it is not the only factor. Many times people define their identity by comparing themselves to other people in their lives. Some research has shown that identity formation is influenced by children's attitudes from the time they're children where they are given a new label. If children are given a new label then they will define themselves as being better and better because of that label. This allows their mind to be used to make sense of the world for them. However, other research studies show that identity is the result of a person's beliefs toward themselves and others. When children believe their value is tied to how good they are, their self-esteem is likely to drop.

Even this modest reward was attacked by the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke","On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by Walter Scott. In the following year, the Tories returned for a second term. On 27 March 1798, Burke retired from public life. On 30 June 1798, he died at the young age of 46.

The man who gave the Tories such a strong foothold in Scotland from 1772 to 1785 was the Earl of Douglas. As Lord Lieutenant of Scotland he was at loggerheads with George III's court. He was a man who had fought many battles; for instance in the Battle of Crécy, where the Scots were routed at the cost of one of their finest regiments. He had survived the massacre of the North-West Highland regiments when he had been on campaign in Poland against Napoleon III. He was a man of great military ability. He had been raised to the peerage just prior to the battle","On 20 June 1794 , Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat , being replaced by Thomas Erskine , his adversary in the trial .

He is best remembered for his long series of speeches on parliamentary privilege in defense of the liberties of the press and the opposition of the Crown and the House of Lords to arbitrary interference by other branches of government , the most complete defense of those principles ever delivered. He also wrote his great historical masterpiece , the History of the French Revolution . Burke died on 27 October 1814 , in Woodcroft ( now part of the town of Woodcroft ) , Kent , England . His body was first buried in Chelsea Old Church , but in 1859 , Burke 's heart and skeleton were removed to rest in Westminster Abbey .

By the 16th century, a cappella polyphony had further developed, but gradually, the cantata began to take the place of a cappella forms. 16th century a cappella polyphony, nonetheless, continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day. Recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by Palestrina, such as what was written for the Sistine Chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ ""doubling"" some or all of the voices. Such is seen in the life of","The polyphony of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century, with compositions by Josquin des Prez.

Carpenters were used to carve woodwind in concert with other instruments as they were first used in public concerts. This became the main compositional method for many of their pieces.

Inventor Johannes Kepler (1471–1543) is credited with introducing the idea of an ""arm on the harp to accompany the rhythm,"" which he would further develop in his work ""Metaphysica.""

It was not until 1844 that composers made the first concerted moves to record themselves on woodwind, a development that would not take place again for about 100 years.

Johann Gottfried Käsebühler (1542–1623) was the first person to apply the term ""wooden string ensemble"" to the musical form, using the term ""musical string instrument","The polyphony of Christian a cappella music began to develop in Europe around the late 15th century , with compositions by Josquin des Prez .

"Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power. Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $US 4.33 billion loan (US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States, the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006. At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, however, American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in check. The","Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe had been devastated by war and its post-war political and social upheavals. Yet the British remained deeply committed to empire, as did most of the European countries. Although Britain had never won a war on home soil, she had been at least as successful at projecting power. Britain's military and economic might provided the United States with a new base to project its imperial ambitions upon. In the decades leading up to the Second World War, Britain's military was transformed, primarily through the efforts of a handful of men at the Ministry of Munitions and of many others at the home front. However, the wartime experience, though traumatic, did not fundamentally alter the nature of the domestic British political landscape.

Lewis argues that Britain's imperial history was more complex and complexly intertwined with its domestic political scene than","Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War , the effects of the conflict were profound , both at home and abroad .

Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth.

"By far the largest military action in which the United States engaged during this era was the War of 1812. With Britain locked in a major war with Napoleon's France, its policy was to block American shipments to France. The United States sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade. Britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on American ships into the Royal Navy, despite intense protests. Britain supported an Indian insurrection in the American Midwest, with the goal of creating an Indian state there that would block American expansion. The United States finally declared war on the United Kingdom in 1812, the first time the U.S. had officially declared war. Not hopeful of defeating the Royal Navy, the U.S. attacked the British Empire by invading British Canada, hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip.

With Britain locked in a major war with the United States, United States warships bombarded British ships, captured over 400 British ships and landed a force of over 15,000 soldiers in Canada. However, these military interventions in the affairs of its neighbors were not a sufficient response to the threat posed by Britain and France. The real threat to the American economy was the war-drenched American economy itself which relied on a series of massive export trade deficits to keep the war-starved country solvent. The United States finally won its War for Independence, but only after decades of military spending and foreign trade embargoes, a military that would become largely unnecessary as a result of a series of technological advances.

"Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed. People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, ""How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?"" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, ""How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?""

The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and complex. Memory is not static; it is continuously stored in our brain. The act of remembering, in the same way the act of making a record is, is an ongoing process of generating new, fresh memory and replaying it from one place to another in time-space so as to obtain a memory of something that occurred later. Memory, it should be emphasized, differs from ordinary memory, which is just remembering what you have been told, in the sense that'memory' refers to memories which represent actual events which occurred to the person at the time and which have not been forgotten by him, in the sense of being remembered only in part.

"A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science,","A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., emotional violence), individual characteristics (e.g., depression), and interpersonal patterns (e.g., interpersonal problems), in which the first two dimensions represent individual behavioral constructs and the interpersonal pattern dimensions are seen as defining personal behavior. In a similar vein, the emotions and disorders theory proposes that there are emotions and disorders which result from the complex interconnections among the three dimensions of emotions described thus far. Although not necessarily exclusive, there is growing evidence in the literature to suggest that, in some cases, only one of the dimensions of emotions is considered important within the field.

This interdependence of individual behavioral constructs that can coactivate or interact with each other has been found to hold true for mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders.

The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory.

It was the first letter they had ever received from each other. This letter revealed an extraordinary relationship between Darwin and Wallace. Here are a few things that we learned that Darwin found out by reading Wallace's letter:

In one letter Wallace mentions the possibility of spontaneous mutation.

The natural selection theory proposed by Darwin was based on both ""junk"" and ""workable"" concepts, i.e., ""junk"" meaning ""not biologically significant or useful, i.e., non-functional but useful,"" whereas ""workable"" means ""useful.""

Darwin's concept of ""natural selection"" was different from Wallace's.

Darwin's concept is based on his belief that genetic variability provides evolutionary pressure, whereas Wallace's believed that environmental variability was the basic principle","Darwin was hard at work on his `` big book '' on Natural Selection , when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace , who stayed on the other side of the world at the time .

"Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts. The critical mindset imparted by","Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology) all played a role in medieval education. In the university we also found, for the first time in European history, the beginnings of the modern university, the universities of the Middle Ages. In addition to these, in the ninth and tenth centuries, universities developed the new discipline of medicine and philosophy, where the natural philosophy which had been taught in the Middle Ages was taken upon university staff. These developments marked the decline of the medieval university and of the university's scientific teaching, or, the university's ""retirement to the countryside"".

What I intend to say with this article is less that medieval universities were better, or better in relation to the knowledge they possessed, than the universities of our day, and more that medieval universities were not always the very best in any of these things. It should be clear at this point that I do not","Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages : natural philosophy , logic , medicine , theology , mathematics , astronomy ( and astrology ) and law .

The study of the humanities and arts in early modern higher education expanded from the study of grammar and rhetoric to the study of languages , literature , history , and philosophy ( natural philosophy , moral philosophy , political philosophy , and metaphysics. ) In the 16th century , the study of science began to become a recognized academic discipline , particularly following the emergence of experimental science and the application of new technologies , beginning in the 16th century at the University of Padua ( with the emergence of. ) The study of natural history began at the late 15th century University of Naples Federico II and the University of Bologna .

"The two major types of nonprofit organization are membership and board-only. A membership organization elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws. A board-only organization typically has a self-selected board, and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board. A board-only organization's bylaws may even state that the organization does not have any membership, although the organization's literature may refer to its donors or service recipients as ""members""; examples of such organizations are Fairvote and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The Model Nonprofit Corporation Act imposes many complexities and requirements on membership decision-making. Accordingly, many organizations, such as Wikimedia, have formed board-only structures.

The officers are entitled to veto changes to the bylaws and to provide the board with nonvoting financial assistance. The board of directors can adopt bylaws that override and supersede the bylaws of the membership organization.

For example, suppose that an association maintains a membership organization and a board-only organization.

This fear was shared by Rome's Greek allies, who had largely ignored Rome in the years after the Second Macedonian War, but now followed Rome again for the first time since that war. A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War, Scipio Africanus, and set out for Greece, beginning the Roman-Syrian War. After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the Battle of Thermopylae (as they believed the 300 Spartans had done centuries earlier).

Consequently, Roman armies moved southward and westward, pushing across England on many occasions. On the north side of the Mersey, along the river, a great force of Roman infantry under Julius Firmicus Albinus was defeated, and after a hard struggle they retreated to the eastern coast, leaving a few foot soldiers behind. In the south, when the Romans encountered Scottish tribes known as the Picts, they lost over two-thirds of their soldiers.

"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders.

"Many cultures define the transition into adultlike sexuality by specific biological or social milestones in an adolescent's life. For example, menarche (the first menstrual period of a female), or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur. In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects. For instance, some","Many cultures define the transition into adultlike sexuality by specific biological or social milestones in an adolescent's life.

At this critical juncture, both Tsar Alexander I and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II decided to engage Napoleon in battle, despite reservations from some of their subordinates. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness.

The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d. 408), Aspar (d. 471), Ricimer (d. 472), or Gundobad (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman background. When the line of western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in","The political structure of Western Europe changed with the end of the united Roman Empire. Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as ""inherited"", the fact is that the Roman republic was a form of government. Unlike the American constitution, the constitution of the Roman empire was a legal document enforced by the militia. This militia-based form of state action remained the basic framework of government for the Romans for the next several hundred years. This period saw further transformations in the structure of the states themselves.

In the years following the collapse of the republic which had been founded by Julius Caesar's conquests in AD 43, Rome was ruled by a series of dictatorships which were the product of the political conflicts between different communities of elites, a process that was to continue for 300 years. These dictatorships were established with the aim to maintain the empire within the boundaries of the Latin-speaking states. Most importantly, with the collapse of the Roman Empire, all the Latin-speaking empires","The political structure of Western Europe changed with the end of the united Roman Empire .

Professors lectured on the books of Aristotle for logic, natural philosophy, and metaphysics; while Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicenna were used for medicine. Outside of these commonalities, great differences separated north and south, primarily in subject matter. Italian universities focused on law and medicine, while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology.

Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. All institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual track.

The best approach was to re-check the records and remove any worn or poorly pressed spots. To avoid a sticky and unwieldy glue, records that show any signs of this are best given a quick wipe-clean, before carefully removing any residue that may have caught on to the disc. However, the glue can be removed using a thin, oil-based cleaner, such as acetone.

While there were no pitched battles, there was repression and death: all political parties were abolished, as were all labor unions and Galician nationalist organizations as the Seminario de Estudos Galegos. Galicia's statute of autonomy was annulled (as were those of Catalonia and the Basque provinces once those were conquered).

The vote went ahead peacefully, although some Catalans did show up en masse to vote in the referendum. One observer, a Catalan journalist named Gisela Dávila, reported that those arriving with ""the intention of exercising their right to vote... were arrested, beaten and subjected to torture.""

Children enter maturity between the ages of 10 and 15. They develop and increase in physical strength and begin to develop social maturity. During this time the child must learn life lessons that provide them with the tools for self-fulfillment. These lessons are best learned through observation of other children and their parents, and by playing the role that is given to the child.

The Role of the Adolescent

A child enters adolescence during a time of transition from childhood to adulthood; this is when the adolescent takes responsibility for the well-being of all family members, the development of skills necessary for","Adolescence marks a rapid change in one 's role within a family . Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully , but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decision - making , except in their own limited area of behavior . In contrast adolescents may become the most influential members of the family in some respects , and may be highly dissatisfied with the decisions , or even the expectations , of parents . However , the research literature concerning the family decision - making process in the adolescent era has been characterized by three features , which I will discuss here in somewhat greater detail . One is the relative lack of attention paid in the research literature to adolescent influences on the process . This contrasts starkly with the research that examines family decision-making in the child or adult period . Although various scholars have speculated about adolescent influence - making , it is only in the last few years that a systematic empirical examination of the adolescent process has been undertaken . My study of a family in which a decision about the educational future of a daughter was under discussion makes a fresh contribution by providing some insight into the process at work .",9.72
"The late 1980s saw a series of liberalising economic reforms within Libya designed to cope with the decline in oil revenues. In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the start of the ""Revolution within a Revolution"", which began with reforms to industry and agriculture and saw the re-opening of small business. Restrictions were placed on the activities of the Revolutionary Committees; in March 1988, their role was narrowed by the newly created Ministry for Mass Mobilization and Revolutionary Leadership to restrict their violence and judicial role, while in August 1988 Gaddafi publicly criticised them, asserting that ""they deviated, harmed, tortured"" and that ""the true revolutionary does not practise repression.""

In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the nationalisation of all oil producing assets at a cut-price of $26 per barrel. Oil production was sharply reduced, with the economy cut by more than 25 per cent and foreign investment effectively restricted. The revolution, however, did not cease in 1988. In December, Gaddafi's former interior minister, Ibrahim Hadiyah, announced that the government would not let the black market operate in the oil industry. While the government claimed that this was in response to calls from the OPEC oil producers, they were probably acting out of fear because they feared they would lose profits from exports.

The oil shock came to an end with the signing of an agreement in June 1987 that created a Libyan-Libyan Oil Development Corporation (LOCODCO) to invest and administer Libyan oil reserves in Sudan and other countries for international investment.

Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a tabula rasa, a ""blank tablet"", in Locke's words ""white paper"", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas.

A major concern of continental philosophy lies with problems of the first-person, so it could, plausibly, be assumed that a first-person perspective on reality would be coherent and illuminating.

However, the logical relations among the different possible ""standpoints"" of reality are themselves difficult to explain. The problems with a first-person perspective can be summarized as follows:

The king ruled from Naples but his daughter Margaret ruled as queen regent in Ardenne.

History Early history The first Native American encampments on what are now Seattle 's Central District streets were Puyallup camps in the 17th century . European immigrants starting to arrive ( and trade ) , including early fur trappers , who had arrived as far back as 1811 , set up forts for protection against Native American raids on their trade goods . With the arrival of settlers from New England , New York City and New Orleans , the area transitioned into what is now known as the Duwamish area , which was inhabited by settlers from the north and west . From there , the settlers set up a Native American community in the Central District . In 1858 , when the United States purchased the land now known as Seattle , this community was relocated further east . However , due to the rapid increase in population , it soon began to expand again , especially after the arrival of rail travel , which allowed for the opening of new neighborhoods in the Duwamish Valley .",9.21

"The European concept of ""race"", along with many of the ideas now associated with the term, arose at the time of the scientific revolution, which introduced and privileged the study of natural kinds, and the age of European imperialism and colonization which established political relations between Europeans and peoples with distinct cultural and political traditions. As Europeans encountered people from different parts of the world, they speculated about the physical, social, and cultural differences among various human groups. The rise of the Atlantic slave trade, which gradually displaced an earlier trade in slaves from throughout the world, created a further incentive to categorize human groups in order to justify the subordination of African slaves. Drawing on Classical sources and upon their own internal interactions — for example, the hostility between the English and Irish powerfully influenced early European thinking about the differences","The European concept of ""race"", along with many of the ideas now associated with the term, arose at the time of the scientific revolution, which introduced the notion of natural selection - the idea that traits are inherited by descent. As with many cultural theories, the theory was later discredited, particularly in the 20th century, when evolutionary theory replaced it.

However, many modern-day Americans think of race as hereditary, with specific genetic differences between different races. People have been fascinated by claims that whites have evolved white skin through the process of selective breeding, while East Asians often have dark skin due to the fact that they had darker skin in their original homeland. Recent research has also shown that our DNA could be viewed as a mixture of European and African DNA, with many areas of the genome potentially influenced by both.","The European concept of `` race '' , along with many of the ideas now associated with the term , arose at the time of the scientific revolution , which began in the mid-17th century .

"The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), for supremacy in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite ""in the near future"".

St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as ""prokathartheisa (prepurified)."" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory.

It was in this way that they believed that she alone was pure from the seed of Adam. In the earliest Christian documents, it is assumed that Mary was assumed into the heavenly realm by Jesus (Matt. 1:23, John 1:30).

If any single corps was attacked, the others could quickly spring into action and arrive to help. Napoleon invaded Prussia with 180,000 troops, rapidly marching on the right bank of the River Saale.

An exclusive boundary arises, for example, when a person adopts a marker that imposes restrictions on the behaviour of others. An inclusive boundary is created, by contrast, by the use of a marker with which other people are ready and able to associate. At the same time, however, an inclusive boundary will also impose restrictions on the people it has included by limiting their inclusion within other boundaries. An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages. Some people may understand the language used by this person while others may not. Those who do not understand it might take the newcomer's use of this particular language merely as a neutral sign of identity.

"To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals – this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants. A herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants, on the other hand, contain complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose. The digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to bacteria that ferment these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet","To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet.

In the case of humans , the placenta provides oxygen and nutrients to the developing baby through its umbilical cord . Some placental mammals use this adaptation to pass antibodies through to the child while it is developing in the womb . Another benefit of using a placenta is to protect mothers from the risk of contracting an infection from the foetus . There are also other groups of mammals that do not use a placenta to nourish their young . One example are marsupials , in which the embryos are only semi–developed when born .

Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers may not be able to safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent the risk of an arc being drawn across from one","To prevent the risk of out-of-phase supplies mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is particularly important for heavy oil deliveries. The equipment used at the line feeders are designed to keep the lines in phase. If these equipment fails, the oil could be exposed to a large degree of error.

All lines must carry the same tank capacity at all times. All the lines must be operated in a coordinated manner to ensure the right amount of oil is being delivered for the best possible quality.

It is particularly important that the pipelines from the pipeline to the storage tanks are kept in phase as a result of their design. It is believed that the best place for the pumps for pumping at least 4 and up to 24 000 gallons of oil is at a designated location for the line feeders in order to assure that they are at the right temperature according to the feeder station they are connected to. Line feeding equipment is designed to keep","To prevent the risk of out-of-phase supplies mixing , sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated . This is achieved by Neutral Sections ( Neutral Grounds ) . The current leaving a neutral section must be the same as the current returning . In addition to Neutral Sections , the feeder station supply to sections of line is often divided into two separate circuits so that any faults in either will ensure current does not carry to other sections of line . Another important concern is the amount of short circuit current delivered to a feeder station . This will decide the design of the switchgear at the station and the size of the transformers used . The short circuit current on an oil-free , dry circuit is usually limited to 0. 16 A but if there are insulated conductors that are likely to be broken under fault conditions , it may be necessary to limit this to 0. 2 A . The minimum size of a transformer is dependent on the short circuit current delivered .",10.97

"The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality.

The best sources of fatty acids are animal fat and high-fat plant foods like coconut oil and flax seeds.

Fatty acids have special structures, known as fatty acid chains, in their chemical structures that can be attached to molecules of fat or other substances, such as sugars, protein, and vitamins. Thus, the essential fatty acid is actually a chain of non-essential fatty acids, made up of chains of alternating fatty acid chains.

Essential fatty acids are considered to be nutrients essential to a healthy body and mind, whereas non-essential fatty acids can be included in any of the normal food groups in a diet.

He recognised the right of the public to seize tube stations and authorised plans to improve their","In the wake of the Coventry Blitz, there was widespread agitation from the Communist Party over the need for bomb-proof shelters. Many Londoners, living in unassuming tenements with little protection, sought their own escape routes. They built underground shelters at the base of apartment buildings, or in their garages, often as temporary measures during the Blitz, only to have them quickly stripped by the authorities during the bombing. By the end of the war, they had taken more than 300,000 lives during the Blitz—more than all German combat deaths.[1]

""The building at 20, Albert Street, was a temporary shelter for the occupants of the nearby apartment block. It had no basement, walls, roof or windows.""

The Underground shelters were also known as ""bomb-proof shelters,"" or ""bomb-proof stoves."" Some of the shelters were in fact converted cellar stoves like the ones described in the poem ""A Room with an Arrow Slit"" by John","In the wake of the Coventry Blitz , there was widespread agitation from the Communist Party over the need for bomb-proof shelters .

"Following the Sergeant Isaac Woodard incident, President Harry S. Truman, himself a combat veteran of World War I, issued Executive Order 9808 establishing the President's Committee on Civil Rights to examine the violence and recommend appropriate federal legislation. Hearing of the incident, Truman turned to NAACP leader Walter Francis White and declared, ""My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that. We've got to do something."" In 1947 the committee published its findings, To Secure These Rights. The book was widely read, influential, and considered utopian for the times: ""In our land men are equal, but they are free to be different.

Truman, himself a combat veteran of World War I, issued Executive Order 9808 establishing the Armed Forces Radio Broadcast Service in June 1942.

Truman's order required all military members to establish and maintain radio stations, to receive regular transmissions from Army units operating in various theaters of operation, to transmit such transmissions, and, of course, to transmit them, not only as a military broadcast but also for their general dissemination through civilian stations and wire services. By issuing his orders, Truman committed the U.S. Army to the radio project.

Despite the war efforts, the radio broadcast service proved to be less efficient than the wire service. This was due to a number of factors, including Army officials' insistence that Army units be authorized to transmit over the radio, without having to first obtain approval from the State Governors. The service also faced logistical difficulties--radio transmission equipment was of poor quality and many stations experienced technical difficulties.

"Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion.

Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther's time. The Catholic reformers did not tolerate, but rather embraced, this fundamental human right. In fact, the reformers understood the Christian religion to be a universal form of religion for all mankind. For Protestants, the Protestant faith held the potential to unite the world's peoples in a shared spiritual world. This idea resonated deeply with the Lutherans.

As a result of Luther's bold stance, the Catholic reformers were forced to give up much of the autonomy they had enjoyed during the Middle Ages. The first Protestant church did not have to adhere to the strict separation of church and state that characterized church-state relations in pre-modern Europe. In fact, Protestant churches maintained some official autonomy in their handling of local affairs.

The papacy did not welcome this new status quo. At least one Protestant preacher, Peter Abel","Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom .

"Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves. By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent’s own self-concept. Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure. Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter.

"In 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, Charles II of England granted William Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony. Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, in what is now the city's Fishtown section. Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for brotherly love (from philos, ""love"" or ""friendship"", and adelphos, ""brother""). As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, far more than afforded by most other colonies, led to better relations with the local Native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city. Penn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government.

Despite the loss of the Great Charter following a series of rebellions, Penn continued to seek new tracts of land. With the help of Pennsylvania legislators, like the Honorable Nathaniel Bradford, he acquired two tracts near Plymouth and another near Philadelphia.

The Treaty of London on April 29, 1691 placed responsibility for paying the debts of the Dutch colony with the French colony. The payment was intended to satisfy the colonists who had protested against payment. After a series of violent raids, in 1692 Penn agreed to cede to the settlers in his lands four of the eight parcels that had been ceded by his predecessor.

In 1693 Penn signed the Treaty of Paris. The next year, Penn's father, Sir John Penn, was born in Holland.

The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: ""On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even","Chapter XI deals with evidence from biogeography, starting with the observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences. Instead, the study of geography shows that, like a fingerprint, the flora and fauna of a region can be predicted for a range of environmental conditions due to the effect of topography and the climate on plant and animal populations. For example, in the New World tropics, most mammal species live in dense forests, with few plants and a low biodiversity. Many areas in North America have similar topographical conditions, but tropical rodents are found nowhere, while carnivores are found throughout the American south.

Cultural influences also alter ecosystems. As the study of the ecology of the human environment has grown, so have new environmental pressures and conflicts.

Most scholars agree that Picts had three classes of citizenship of which the upper class were the nobility and the lower were the people.

In a letter to the British magazine Open, Makdisi stated that in his opinion ""Muslim and western concepts are complementary"", arguing not only that Europe has made many of its own innovations and the Islamic scholar ""would like to see more in the West than the western concepts in Islam that have had influence on the Islamic world"", but that Makdisi also wants to create new concepts with Western counterparts and that he ""understands the value of the West's inventions in the modern world and in the Islamic world"" [4].

The plot is for more than just entertainment purposes; within it lies information about economics, psychology, science, religions, politics, cultures, and social depth.

"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the ""Forty acres and a mule"" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term ""affirmative action"" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure","Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources to adequately take charge of political and economic decisions. That problem resulted in the so-called ""black code"" by which black Americans must give the state money for a ""necessary"" thing in order to get preferential treatment.

As I wrote last month, it was these practices that led to the establishment of the federal government as a governing body. Instead of empowering blacks, the black code helped cement white supremacy by giving them control over state government resources and power.

"Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the ""non-breeding"" plumage, or—in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology—""basic"" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as ""alternate"" plumages. Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap.","Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the ""non-breeding plumage"".

The feathers on the head and flanks, the talons and the beak (gizzard) are all considered part of the pre-breeding plumage and so must be removed, and sometimes a part of a bird that has moulted must be preserved to protect itself from predation.

It is thought that after breeding the sexes develop different plumage, because in early development, all other parts of the bird are covered with the same feather cells.

However, not all parts of the plumage are equally important in survival. The beak is thought to be one of the most important parts in pre-breeding plumage because of the importance of a beak to feeding, and to helping a bird keep a balance in balance between itself and the environment.

"As cellular metabolism/energy production requires oxygen, potentially damaging (e.g., mutation causing) compounds known as free radicals can form. Most of these are oxidizers (i.e., acceptors of electrons) and some react very strongly. For the continued normal cellular maintenance, growth, and division, these free radicals must be sufficiently neutralized by antioxidant compounds. Recently, some researchers suggested an interesting theory of evolution of dietary antioxidants. Some are produced by the human body with adequate precursors (glutathione, Vitamin C), and those the body cannot produce may only be obtained in the diet via direct sources (Vitamin C in humans, Vitamin A, Vitamin K) or produced by the body from other compounds (Beta-carotene converted to Vitamin A by the body, Vitamin D synthesized from cholesterol by sunlight). Phytochemicals (Section Below) and their subgroup, polyphenols, make up the majority of antioxidants; about 4,000 are known. Different antioxidants are now known to function in a cooperative network.

Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life.

Unfortunately, this kind of comparison is difficult to prove when it comes to Luther's writings.

"The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data. If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former must be at least deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement. Remember that the translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor","The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical reality had very different implications from statements about mental objects. Physical states are no longer simply mental objects on which to pin our attention, but are rather something much deeper to be looked at in terms of what it means for a set of statements to be true or false. For instance, statements about the motion of a ship cannot be regarded as true or false because motion does not occur at all in the mind and no laws or relationships exist to connect a thought about motion with the actual motion of the ship itself.

Despite the growing appreciation of the fundamental difference between physical and mental states of affairs, the phenomenalist, despite being generally a naturalist, felt a sort of hesitance to drop his metaphysics in response to physicalism. But the post-Humean world seems to be so radically different from the mentalist world (where mental states","The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s , for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about physical experiences . The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ends by the early 1940s ; this phase was due to be replaced by the reductionist phase , as it became clear that scientific statements about macroscopic and microscopic objects could not be. However , we have seen that the arguments that ended the phenomenalist phase of empiricism and replaced it with the reductionist phase are all circular : they rely for their force on the meaning of concepts in the theory that is supposed to replace the phenomenalist. The first step in the reductionist phase is to find macroscopic concepts that will be used to replace all of the phenomenalist concepts — that is , concepts that will do most of the work in accounting for phenomenalist statements . If that is done , the argument that replaces the phenomenalist theory with the reductionist theory has the form : ( 1 ) The reductionist theory is complete . All truths about the phenomenon are statements that can be deduced by the reductionist theory from the laws of physics and from empirical generalizations about phenomena .",8.38

"Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses).

Thus, in their case, perhaps it may be suggested that blue jays might ""famine"" for a period of several decades as their natural environment becomes too large for them. Perhaps if the blue jays were to become extremely numerous, their natural habitat would be destroyed and they would lose their natural range. This would be a problem for these blue jays, and the more that were killed en masse, the worse their plight would become. It might appear that the blue jays starve themselves over time by their own actions, but there is one catch.

There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort—the Theodosian Code—was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis.

"By August 1805, Napoleon had realized that the strategic situation had changed fundamentally. Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies, he decided to strike first and turned his army's sights from the English Channel to the Rhine. His basic objective was to destroy the isolated Austrian armies in Southern Germany before their Russian allies could arrive. On 25 September, after great secrecy and feverish marching, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 260 km (160 mi). Austrian commander Karl Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Swabia. Napoleon swung his forces to the southeast and the Grande Armée performed an elaborate wheeling movement that outflanked the Austrian positions. The Ulm Maneuver completely surprised General Mack, who belatedly understood that his army had been cut off. After some minor engagements that culminated in the Battle of Ulm, Mack finally surrendered after realizing that there was no way to break out of the French encirclement. For just 2000 French casualties, Napoleon had managed to capture a","By August 1805, Napoleon had realized that the strategic situation had changed fundamentally. Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies, he decided to strike out from his French territories and drive the British out of the islands. His goal was to gain control of the islands and prevent the spread of the French Revolution by reducing or destroying their British protector. However, the French Army was spread too thin and was completely unprepared to win the land war; they simply retreated back to France. Napoleon went back to Europe to plan where to go next, and as his invasion time grew close, he received news of the British plan that Napoleon's main army was too spread out to effectively attack. He knew how he had failed in France and that he had no better option now; he made the decision to withdraw, and in August 1805, he sailed from France for the final time. His retreat was not without cost and resulted in the loss of many of his best commanders who were killed or captured. Napoleon's retreat","By August 1805 , Napoleon had realized that the strategic situation had changed fundamentally . Facing a potential invasion from his continental enemies , he decided to strike first and decisively . In a major act of pre-emptive self-defense , he sent a series of detachments of 5,000 soldiers and 1,500 horsemen down the coast into Spain . The objective of the troops , under Marshal Michel Ney , was to capture the strategically important port city of Cádiz on the east coast of Spain and to occupy it as a base from which to attack England . The campaign to occupy Cádiz and then to besiege it during the summer of 1805 thus began as a major expeditionary raid against Spain . The strategy of Napoleonic France in 1805 was an attempt to avoid a two - front war . Rather than face war with everyone in Europe simultaneously , Napoleon sought to use the campaign against Cádiz and Spain in general in order to deal with one major enemy at the present time while preparing to engage others . It was a strategy of `` limited war , '' to use a modern expression , against Spain at the behest of revolutionary and radical Spain .",9.57

The report also cites concerns over potential cuts in the defence science and technology research budget; implications of inappropriate estimation of Defence Inflation within budgetary processes; underfunding in the Equipment Programme; and a general concern over striking the appropriate balance over a short-term focus (Current Operations) and long-term consequences of failure to invest in the delivery of future UK defence capabilities on future combatants and campaigns.","The Defence Committee—Third Report ""Defence Equipment 2009"" cites an article from the Financial Times website stating that the Chief of Defence Materiel, Brigadier General Tim Collins:

The article also states:

""Mr Collins said that while the service had been able to cut costs by $700 million (£540m), any savings were not enough to compensate for $7.4 billion spent on the new fleet of five F-35 jets, which are not expected into service until 2021-22.""

The problem has been caused by defence budget cuts initiated by the United Kingdom before the election of the Conservative Party in 1997 with a view to reducing the military strength . However , more recent spending proposes that the army will not be reduced below 102,000 personnel as early as 2017 — a figure that is to be reached in just 82 % of the time. It is thus unsurprising that there are many gaps in the equipment that are required to be fielded before that year . The Defence Committee concludes from this that the Department of Defence can not fulfil its obligation to the Army to equip it adequately—not least in view of the fact that the army is expected to be at only 50 % strength by 2016 .

See here for more about Sulami).

The most important and relevant of the mystical thinkers of Sulami's era, other than Sulami himself, was Abu 'Ali Muhammad (d. 855).

In the U.K., when a bar used to serve beer in the pub, it was usually from the brewery, with people ordering from the bar, and the bar owner taking an order from the customer. The pub would charge for the beer and that money would go to the brewery. If you got a pint of ale and someone asked for a pint of Coke, you could drink both before you were able to get your money back. If it rained, it meant that the beer drinkers had to wait for the tap to refill. Then the brewer got a cut, of course, but the pub owner got nothing.

On July","The Third (1919–23) and Fourth Aliyahs (1924–29) brought an additional 100,000 Jews to Palestine. Finally, in the wake of World War II the state of Israel was established, giving new impetus to the immigration. Jews from all over the Near East were added, bringing the total number of non-Jewish immigrants to nearly half a million. The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1924 further encouraged immigration by the passage of the National Origins Act of 1924, which added the provision of naturalization for those already living in the United States that they had ""come as a migrant."" In response, many Jews in the United States, and in European countries in general, began to claim they had already ""come as immigrants"" rather than as second- or third-generation immigrants.

There is evidence that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to have followed the following sequence: 1) cold working of native copper, 2) annealing, 3) smelting, and 4) the lost wax method. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these metallurgical techniques appears more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c. 7500 BC.

It has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old, and its use in jewellery has been documented from 5000 BC. Its use in jewelry has continued into the present-day.

The most interesting thing about copper is the amount of copper it contains, and the fact that it is a metal with a fairly high melting point. Copper is a metal with an extremely large amount of energy stored in it, and the heat produced during the melting process can be used to create electricity. One of the reasons why the Romans used copper rather than iron for their weapons was the fact that copper held a higher thermal conductivity compared to iron. A high heat transfer coefficient allowed more heat to be carried away in one direction, making the metal the ideal choice for weapons.

How can I tell if copper is being used in a current project or not?

The site was located just a few kilometres away from the parliament and was earmarked for high-rise office buildings.

As Delhi did not have any major airport then and the location of the new airport was found to be a disadvantage, it was decided to transfer the airport to Ahmedabad, which was the second most populous city in India.

Although this rule change has been long anticipated, some ISPs, such as Comcast and AT&T have pushed behind the scenes ever since as to how it might affect their services. To be able to sell their customers' data, the FCC will therefore need to consider a number of relevant factors.

While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force.

They arrived too late. In the following month, the Austrian Emperor Joseph II, who was fighting for his life at Toscana with the Austro-Hungarian forces besieging the city, surrendered. With these events in mind, Napoleon set out west for the Netherlands. He found a powerful stateless people that had survived for hundreds of years. In 1801 the Dutch were still fighting to survive, with some even using cannibalism. Although they were still in the process of changing their culture, the Dutch were also growing in numbers. By the 1790s, the Dutch had become the second largest population in the western world after France.

The evidence of this mode of running can still be seen on the track down the slope on the northern access to the abandoned Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, United Kingdom, where the slot between the running rails is clearly visible, and on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington DC, where the abandoned tracks have not been paved over.

As mentioned above the conduits used for streetcars must have been very similar in construction and materials, in order that a modern electric network could be constructed with no more of an issue then the street cable.


So, what we do know, is that, the street cable wasn't electrified in most areas, and that, some street trams used conduits. In most cases, it wasn't until much later, with the advent of the electric car, that the conduits became electrically powered.

"In 1877, Thomas Edison invented the phonograph. Unlike the phonautograph, it was capable of both recording and reproducing sound. Despite the similarity of name, there is no documentary evidence that Edison's phonograph was based on Scott's phonautograph. Edison first tried recording sound on a wax-impregnated paper tape, with the idea of creating a ""telephone repeater"" analogous to the telegraph repeater he had been working on. Although the visible results made him confident that sound could be physically recorded and reproduced, his notes do not indicate that he actually reproduced sound before his first experiment in which he used tinfoil as a recording medium several months later. The tinfoil was wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder and a sound-vibrated stylus indented the tinfoil while the cylinder was rotated. The recording could be played back immediately.

Unlike the phonautograph, it was capable of both recording and reproducing sound. Despite the huge advances made throughout the century, the technology remained somewhat inefficient. The phonautographer was expensive, prone to malfunction and would require manual adjustments due to the poor quality of microphones and speaker combinations.

In 1927, J. P. Morgan and J. W. Carnegie had the idea to combine Edison's invention with other new technologies to create the first commercial computer. To create a sound recording of the same length as a human voice, a two-inch tape was mounted with a microphone to record audio with the voice. Using a reel-to-reel player, players would play a record using an electromagnet, which would rotate the tape along with the needle, resulting in recording sound. At this level of performance, the record could be sent across the radio frequency transmission spectrum by radio receivers, effectively creating a computer.

"The brief peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to focus on the French colonies abroad. Saint-Domingue had managed to acquire a high level of political autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars, with Toussaint Louverture installing himself as de facto dictator by 1801.

Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented.

This allowed the Haitian government to pursue its own policies for the majority of the population under the protection of the French.

With St. Domingue being the most important colonial possession for England, a series of English and French interventions occurred in the city. The French did not want to relinquish any of their territories, but were unwilling to fight for their independence until they had a large standing army to defend the entire colony.

The French, on the other hand, used military force to maintain their rule; they were not content to allow the Haitian government to govern the city without their intervention. This would lead to several conflicts, the most serious of which is known as the Haitian War of Independence.

Poets following Virgil often refer intertextually to his works to generate meaning in their own poetry. The Augustan poet Ovid parodies the opening lines of the Aeneid in Amores 1.1.1–2, and his summary of the Aeneas story in Book 14 of the Metamorphoses, the so-called ""mini-Aeneid"", has been viewed as a particularly important example of post-Virgilian response to the epic genre.

In a way, it's the classic recording for its time. Though Gabler uses a more technical approach than many sound men of the time, he still makes interesting use of the microphones and his own vocal stylings to create a story and, most importantly, capture the essence of the events taking place. There is a great deal of tension and mystery built into each recording. Here, he is in a small cottage; a very dangerous place to be at night. One minute he's out front; the next, up inside his own home. There's lots of very tense moments of negotiation, some shouting and much shouting.

"However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid. In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features:","However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a leaf. For example, if the leaf is dropping from a tree or from the top of a house, then the leaf falling will cause the falling tree or the falling house to collapse (if its base is weak enough). And from this the result follows that the leaf fell from god which leads one to ask the question of ""why god would allow the leaf to fall from a non-god""? And if the leaves fall from something which is a tree than the question ""why on earth would the leaf fall from the top of something which is not an actual tree"" also arises, this leads in two interesting directions.

I would also consider the question why God would allow the leaf to fall from something which is a tree (even the top of a tree), but never the other way around.

And it also bears mentioning that any argument","However , asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes on the ground ( the case of the cup being smashed is not made possible by an agent of which the hand is part and the spilling of its contents is not made impossible ) ; or , more generally , the case of an entity performing a particular action.

"John treated the interdict as ""the equivalent of a papal declaration of war"". He responded by attempting to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly with the authorities in Rome. John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him. In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates. By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton's appointment.

The Council in Florence took up the new conditions imposed by Innocent, but the pope was convinced that he would prevail over the papal forces, so he withdrew his forces from that province until his situation improved as the councils passed.

"The deliberate or accidental hybridising of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown in recent times for economic purposes. The number of successful interspecific mammalian hybrids is relatively small, although it has come to be known that there is a significant number of naturally occurring hybrids between forms or regional varieties of a single species.[citation needed] These may form zones of gradation known as clines. Indeed, the distinction between some hitherto distinct species can become clouded once it can be shown that they may not only breed but produce fertile offspring. Some hybrid animals exhibit greater strength and resilience than either parent. This is known as hybrid vigor. The existence of the mule (donkey sire; horse dam) being used widely as a hardy draught animal throughout ancient and modern history is testament to this. Other well known examples are the lion/tiger hybrid, the liger,","The deliberate or accidental hybridising of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and is not now considered in the same category as genetic engineering,"" said a statement from the Environment Agency.

Genetic engineers have modified plants, animals, insects, fungal spores, bacteria and micro-organisms for medical, research or agricultural uses. They are used in laboratories, in the food industry, and in pest controllers.

The potential benefits of cross - breeding have also been recognised by the authorities on occasion , for instance the deliberate attempts to preserve and develop species such as the Bengal Tiger or the Indian Elephant . In other cases there have been unintended results , one of which has been to increase the size of a ' target ' species from smaller to larger examples .

"A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source.

Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism."" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men.

"As Muslim institutions of higher learning, the madrasa had the legal designation of waqf. In central and eastern Islamic lands, the view that the madrasa, as a charitable endowment, will remain under the control of the donor (and their descendent), resulted in a ""spurt"" of establishment of madaris in the 11th and 12th centuries. However, in Western Islamic lands, where the Maliki views prohibited donors from controlling their endowment, madaris were not as popular. Unlike the corporate designation of Western institutions of higher learning, the waqf designation seemed to have led to the exclusion of non-orthodox religious subjects such a philosophy and natural science from the curricula. The madrasa of al-Qarawīyīn, one of the two surviving madaris that predate the founding of the earliest medieval universities and are thus claimed to be the ""first universities"" by some authors, has acquired official university status as late as","As Muslim institutions of higher learning, the madrasa had the legal designation of waqf. In central and eastern Islamic lands, the view that clerics should focus exclusively on their religious duties carried much more weight - and with it, the legitimacy of the waqf system. From the 12th through the 14th centuries Islamic scholars developed this conception and its logical opposite, ""sharif."" Sharif also involved the acceptance of the jurisprudence of the caliph, and the establishment of institutions under the shari'a law. As we shall see below, only a small minority of Sunni theologians in the early 19th century called Shariah shari'a. The majority of those clerics (most of whom, like Muhammad Husayn ibn Munabbih, belonged to the Mu'tazilite stream of jurisprudence) argued that any government that established the authority of clerics over the public sphere would have violated the sacred law of shari'a. This position","As Muslim institutions of higher learning , the madrasa had the legal designation of waqf . In central and eastern Islamic lands , the view that the madrasa , as a place of religious instruction , should be separate from secular learning gradually emerged . Madrasa education was a means of acquiring higher learning and knowledge , not a primary education . The education that was imparted at the madrasa was intended to help students acquire religious knowledge , and was not an attempt to build rational thinkers or people of science and discovery . Many Islamic scholars during the medieval period felt that the madrasa was also meant to serve as a vehicle for the propagation of Islam throughout the world . The word madrasa can refer to the institution as well as to its student body , where the word was commonly used in the 16th century to describe students that either resided at a mosque , or were attached to it . A student at a madrasa was sometimes known as a muḥṣib ( literally , `` one who is concerned with religious studies `` ) , and in order to differentiate from other forms of higher education , they were also referred to as madrasa mu. The Madrasa would also send its students out in the community to preach , known as khatmiyya , literally `` spread out `` .",9.0
