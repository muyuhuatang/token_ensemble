"The amnesty applies to offences committed during the political turmoil after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. The lower house passed the controversial bill in the early hours of Friday. It now goes to the Senate. The opposition Democrat Party has warned that the passage of the bill will trigger street protests. It did not take part in the vote, but the bill passed by 310 votes to 0.

But this could happen as early as next week and would almost certainly provoke further protests. Advocates of the bill say it will draw a line under the political turmoil that resulted from the military coup in 2006 that removed Mr Thaksin from power, leaving Thailand bitterly divided.

The lower house passed the controversial bill in the first reading on 2 February, but the Senate, dominated by Mr Thaksin loyalists, has delayed by several weeks the decision on whether to approve it in a final vote on 28 February.

A senior Thai official said Mr Vajiralongkorn was expected to make a statement when he was set to meet Pope Francis at the Vatican in a few days' time. He is not scheduled to visit the country's parliament, the plenary, until later in October, he said. A Thai official said the meeting was expected this week.

According to the Guardian, the Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said in reaction to the Vatican's silence that in any country where Mr Thaksin was there was ""a political struggle and a lot of tension and the responsibility of the government is to respect that, to avoid abuses"".

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry.

The first is the 'Walk for Unity' organised by the Protestant Coalition and the Unionist Executive, which is due to take place along the Donegall Street Parade route the week of January 14th and has been described as ""a peaceful, joyful, family-friendly and fun-filled event with great public interaction"".

"The Employment and Learning minister, Dr Stephen Farry, has decided to remove a special premium payment of Â£1.1m which it has been getting to compensate for its small scale and specialist status. It has fewer than 1,000 students and an income of Â£4.7m a year. Protesters have said that the removal of the small institution premium, coupled with a general cutback in Department of Employment and Learning (DEL) funding, would mean the college loses 31% of its budget. However, an extra Â£32m for the DEL, revealed in this week's overall budget improves the situation somewhat. The college says the addition of extra money means it would be asked to manage on a budget reduced by 26.5%.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year.

""Patients would pay the money upfront to the consultant, rather than making appointments or paying through their GP on a per visit basis,"" said a Department of Health spokesman. ""Patients can decide where they want to have their appointments or where they want to pay.""

Currently, the amount that patients pay to consultants depends on their area of speciality. Consultants pay between £30 and £45 for each additional consultation in the GP network, for example. The department said that it would be the aim to roll out the scheme across the country.

"The Sakurajima volcano on Japan's Kyushu island poses a ""growing threat"", researchers at the University of Bristol say. The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific ""Ring of fire"", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano.

According to the study, the seismic activity is linked to seismic activity inside the volcano.

The study is published today in the journal Scientific Reports. It was led by Dr Simon Boxall from the University's School of Earth Sciences and the School of Physics, led by Dr Ewan Birney.

The team say the amount of seismic activity has increased by more than a factor of five since the volcano erupted on March 1st.

"The group behind London Array wind farm said it would take three years to look at the possible effect of the extra turbines on red-throated divers. It had hoped to increase the number of turbines between Kent and Essex to 341. The area is the winter home of about 6,500 red-throated divers - at least one third of the UK's population. London Array said it had formally requested The Crown Estate to terminate the agreement for lease for the phase two area and had cancelled the grid capacity that was reserved at the National Grid substation in Graveney, Kent. The wind farm, 10 miles north of Ramsgate, Kent, was given the green light in 2006 on condition that phase two, to add an extra 166 turbines, would only go ahead if the red-throated divers were protected. The RSPB was concerned the population of the birds in the outer Thames estuary could be displaced by the extension. London","The group behind London Array wind farm said it would take three years to look at the possible effect of the extra turbines on red-throated divers.

A spokesman said the turbines were not visible from a distance, but he added they may well show up at low tide.

The UK has been given permission by the European Commission to build 10 wind farms by 2020.

The proposals include six on the west coast of Britain and four on the North Sea.

What is London Array? London Array is a project by French energy firm EDF. It aims to use turbines to store the electricity generated by wind farms, and convert that into electricity at a cheaper rate than the traditional power station

In March, EDF said that the project would cost £1.2bn (3.3 billion euros), which is expected to be paid for from the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive. These subsidies are designed to encourage wind power generation

If the findings confirmed the concerns about red-throated divers , the development could be delayed several years .

Each will be treated on its merits, said F1 director Charlie Whiting. Whiting added some of the controversial incidents last year related to this issue would potentially be treated differently were similar ones to occur in 2017. ""Before we said any move under braking would be investigated,"" Whiting said. ""Now, we have a simple, broad rule that says effectively if a driver moves erratically or goes unnecessarily slowly or behaves in a manner that could endanger another driver then he will be investigated."" Whiting said the idea for a ""more general way of approaching things"" had come about as a result","A regulation banning a practice known as ""moving under braking"" was adopted last year after drivers complained about Red Bull's Max Verstappen. But in a first, it was issued on Monday instead of last week after the Belgian newspaper Le Soir found evidence of the practice at the Barcelona track.

It happened when another driver and a marshal were talking about a crash involving Verstappen on Sunday and asked the marshal: ""Did Max use his brakes?""

Verstappen said yes, the marshal replied, but Verstappen's car was fitted with sensors which registered whether he had applied the brakes or not.

That is likely to have allowed Red Bull to use that information to assess the driver, either during or after a crash.

Le Soir found that a marshal had written that Verstappen's car had been fitted with the sensor as a ""cost saving measure"".

The maths behind them was discovered after an international team of scientists used a computer to test what happened to the energy of the universe at various points in time.

The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, looked at three dimensions of the space-time fabric.

For each axis, there is a 'big bang' for which we can calculate the temperature and density conditions as they changed.

These include an analysis of all the suicides in Britain between 1999 and 2002 in which an individual was taking an antidepressant and the year before, and comparing such individuals with people who did not take an antidepressant, which yielded an increased risk of suicide of nearly 20 percent for those who took the antidepressants.

Its skipper, John McFall said the boat, named the Daring, would have needed to be anchored more than 100 metres in front of the propeller to prevent the engine from grinding against the back of the craft. However, in order for the vessel to be safe the ship's rudder had to be raised to keep it on its course and prevent it from being turned off. Despite this, the boat came within 300 metres of the submarine.

According to reports, McFall feared for his life and decided to dive to the bottom to retrieve the rudder, only to realise the boat was too damaged to pull himself on board. The decision to stay on board had to stand to ensure the vessel was undamaged and that McFall was unhurt if the craft sank.

Scotland are due to face Wales on Friday, but they will only do so as the home nation.

The Welsh have to change their format - meaning one minute in the second half instead of one minute in the first half - but it should make for more competitive and entertaining half-time entertainment.

It is a good opportunity for Wales coach Chris Coleman to get a grip on the game after England's poor start.

Wales had a good start and only conceded two tries against Canada and then looked impressive again at Twickenham in the autumn internationals.

The players should do well - and even if England do win against Wales, they will win comfortably by at least three tries - but it is vital that they have enough good, solid performances against Wales.

"Childcare and early years researcher David Dallimore of Bangor University wants an overhaul of education provision for three to four-year-olds. He told BBC's Eye on Wales: ""It's one of the things we haven't done well in Wales is have a long-term vision for our early years services."" The Welsh government said it can consider its options once the detail of the proposed Childcare Bill is known. Currently, all three and four-year-olds are entitled to a minimum of 10 hours education delivered through the Foundation Phase. Each of the 22 councils choose how they deliver those hours for three year olds and how much they spend on it. Because of this, levels and flexibility of provision vary enormously from county to county.

In contrast to England, this provision is mainly provided through state","Childcare and early years researcher David Dallimore of Bangor University wants an overhaul of education provision for three to four-year-olds. He argues that in many of the country's pre-primary schools, children are being taught too little, too young, not in an age-appropriate manner.

""When we look across the whole age spectrum, we see that the majority of the children being educated in childcare as an early years component are less than three years old,"" he said.

A key part of his research focus is the state of early years education in Scotland and the United Kingdom. This year he compiled data for an international comparison of early education, and is now calling for government intervention to improve standards across the board.

He said: ""While the average age of four-year-olds in the UK and Scotland today is seven, the average age of children at primary school is one. At younger ages, these children are being held back at the hands of","Childcare and early years researcher David Dallimore of Bangor University wants an overhaul of education provision for three to four-year-olds . He told BBC 's Eye on Wales : `` I think we should extend the funded early years provision for the under-fives so all those children can have the education the parents can afford but ca n't afford enough money to keep them in full-time early years settings from about 3. 30 pm until 6 pm . It 's something we can debate . `` I think [ the government 's funding ] will be better spent in terms of having better trained teachers in early years education because it will enable us to educate all of our three to five year olds . It would also give that continuity of provision across the child 's years to enable us to help them be better prepared for the move to school . So I think it would be a very cheap way of improving the whole early years education experience across the country . “ Eye on Wales , 20 October 2012 11.",8.69

The 72km (44 mile) route is meant to be completed by August 2018, after a construction time of about seven months.

Some campaigners, including a senior Conservative MP, have raised concerns that the new cycle route will be too slow. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said speed was not an issue on the existing route.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has ruled he was lawfully killed by police.

The two-week trial in the Old Bailey started last month. The CPS is expected to make its announcement shortly after the jury returns on February 2.

A CPS spokesman added: ""We have no further comment to make.""

The trial is the second by the IPCC in Northern, and the first in England and Wales, and is the culmination of two investigations into deaths of unarmed, black people by police.

The investigation was prompted after Odebrecht pleaded guilty to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to politicians, public officials and their relatives and business associates around the world.

Israel and Hezbollah are close to a cross-border ceasefire, brokered in June by the US secretary of state John Kerry.

Last month, after Hezbollah fighters fired rockets on Tel Aviv, a group of Israeli reservists opened fire, shooting dead one man from the Hezbollah cell, in an incident that has not been brought to court.

Israel withdrew its troops from Lebanese airspace as part of the June truce but has kept its forces stationed on Lebanon's northern border.

"Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say. Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: ""Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this. ""It is important that we understand how social media use relates to these. Evidence is increasingly supporting","Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say.

""People who use social media at night are more likely to be depressed, more likely to seek the help of their medical profession, more likely to binge drink — and more likely to use illegal drugs,"" the researchers wrote in their findings.

The study is the first to show increased negative emotions in night users compared with those who wake up.

The findings indicate that not all night users experience increased negative emotions.

""This is very important because night activity is only one of many factors that contribute to negative emotions. In this study, the use of social media is one factor among many, and it is only one factor among other contributors,"" co-author Dr. Steven C. Davis, chairman and co-director of the Center on Health Disparities and Health Disparities Research, said in the statement.

","Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media , and who use it at night , were more likely to feel depressed and anxious , they say . But they also found positive correlations that contradict those earlier findings . Anxiety , depression do n't stop students from using social media ( Feb. 24 ) , so if students are using social media at night to seek information that can be comforting in times as stressful as the ones created by the COVID - 19 pandemic , it is not surprising that it has a positive effect , the.

Researchers have found that using an algorithm that identifies common experiences shared by humans can improve AI learning . `` It seems that social media platforms have a direct effect on health ( especially on the physical health of the heart ) `` The study shows that the effect is not trivial ( in fact even small ) `` Social media use is not just a passive activity . In contrast to popular opinion : The impact of social media use on the population health was much more important than the health benefits of exercise or physical activity , researchers said .",9.17

"STUC general secretary Grahame Smith will warn that it could take time to take advantage of new devolved powers. Responsibilities over income tax and welfare will be transferred to MSPs from April 2017. Mr Smith will make the plea as the STUC annual congress begins in Dundee on Monday. The general secretary of the Scottish Trades Unions Congress believes the campaign in the run-up to May's election ""doesn't yet reflect the possibilities provided by new powers"". Mr Smith said the vote would be ""the most important election to take place since the Scottish Parliament was re-established in 1999"". He wants party leaders to bring forward ""bold ambitious policies"" that will attempt to tackle some of the ""hitherto intractable problems in the Scottish economy and society"". Mr Smith will say: ""The next Scottish government really has to aspire to more than just managerial competence. ""Unfortunately, the campaign going on around us doesn't yet reflect the possibilities provided by new powers. Indeed, the nature and quality of debate suggests that it could take some time for our political parties","STUC general secretary Grahame Smith will warn that it could take time to take advantage of new devolved powers. Responsibilities over income tax and benefits have proved too complex and divisive in Scotland, with each side in the debate blaming the other for the failings.

His intervention will be made at a series of meetings from Wednesday until Friday as he attempts to convince the Scottish government to commit to greater tax spending.

An independent Scotland may be forced to keep using a range of current rates of income tax as well as new tax credits such as Universal Credit, which means the Scottish government could become liable for paying taxes at a higher rate than the rest of the UK, and the UK as a whole.

Mr Smith is also highlighting suggestions that a further new tax could be introduced in Scotland – a more substantial income tax rate. Scottish ministers are expected to face an unexpected challenge from Westminster when they meet later this month to discuss which of the two new tax options would be introduced first.","STUC general secretary Grahame Smith will warn that it could take time to take advantage of new devolved powers .

During his speech in Inverness Mr Smith will say : `` Devolution is no ‘ silver bullet ’ for all of the challenges that we face in Scotland but it is an important tool in the armoury . `` However we need to make sure that we do not repeat past mistakes and , as in the past when Scotland had limited fiscal powers , we do not allow this new devolution to simply become a new form of ' tax raising without tax spending ’ “.",8.15

He suggested that Ms Huws might be reluctant because her Welsh language ability was so low, adding: ""The high perceived need for a specialist language is likely to also be a factor.""

He said that while this was probably the case for most native speakers it might not explain all linguistic differences.

Prof Jones added that in some cases having a linguistic background might mean people ""seem more fluent in their own tongue"".

The justices accepted a petition from Gloucester County, Virginia, ruling that the school board was not required to comply with a lower court's order that transgender student Gavin Grimm should be allowed to use the boys' bathroom.
