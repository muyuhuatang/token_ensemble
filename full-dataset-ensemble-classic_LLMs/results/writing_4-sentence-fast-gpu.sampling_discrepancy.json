In the beginning, friends and family thought it was a joke. The doctors thought me a liar. There was no possible scientific explanation for a disease that would make one dance, of all things, whenever music was heard. It just made no sense. But when we discovered that it was contagious, that I spread the disease wherever I went, the doctors started studying me seriously. Still, at the time it was still just a passing curiosity, and no hindrance to everyday life. The unease began when it turned out that the spread of the disease started to accelerate. The doctors, through careful experimentation, discovered that the disease had a delayed onset upon exposure.

More trucks for businesses (some with strange names that no one had ever heard of,) their beds full of the King and Queen of every concept imaginable. More clowns, more funny cars, and worst of all - more Parade Officials. The first year it happened, the Parade went on for hours.
