The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This greater total mass makes for more planets, but since they",

Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had a choice. What you're doing here is",

I began to keep an eye out, get an idea of where she would be in comparison to me.'Stalk' is too strong a word, it was more that I paid attention to what she did more than is usual. A small conversation on the way to class was a victory, a wave and exchange of greetings progress. She became more important to me than I thought possible. Then a day came where her smiles were hesitant, beginning timidly and ending much too soon. Her eyes would flick from surface to surface, wavering as she tried to distract herself. Fewer gestures, more constraint when she was supposed to be care free, joyous and brilliant.",
        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

They don't leave the weak, sick or old behind. Hierarchies are obeyed and troublemakers are kicked out, but not killed. This is a good society. A noble one. The tractor wheels slow",

But the third nob.... Grace didn't know what that might be. She closed both taps and the faucet stopped running. She would try the third one next. Like everything in Giovanni's workshop, it would probably be something wonderful and unexpected. Birds flew out of drawers when she opened them. The birds were red and green and gold and didn't look like any birds Grace had ever seen, not even when Giovanni had taken her to the aviary at the zoo. The kitchen had these strange machines with gears and pipes that played beautiful music when he tinkered in there. The mirrors were very nice and gave her the most lovely complements",

Her parents first noticed their child was gifted as an infant. The vine outside her window had crept in, twining around her cradle one summer day, the leaves tickling her nose as she laughed. When she learned to crawl the flowers turned toward her, as if she were the sun. Her mom started a garden, and let her wander among the rows. Their vegetables were always the biggest and the tastiest as the Farmers Market, their booth always sold out before 10. On their way home Ophelia watched as they delivered half their crops to the food kitchen, telling her it was important to give",

Only problem is that she is in a coma and they have no clue when she will wake up. Jane Doe -- no one knows what her real name is. She was in a horrible car accident and she had no identification of who she is with her when she was in the accident. Now she's in a coma and I'm her doctor.

I exit my cell and join the orange stream moving to the dining area. One of the first things I notice here is the cutting glances of hate thrown my way. Perhaps it's because I'm new. Maybe it has something to do with my mysterious appearance here. Regardless, the way the inmates whisper amongst themselves and point at me makes it clear that I am in imminent danger.

The thought of being bitter about bringing joy to one of the only cool people I know anymore was pretty entertaining to me, made me chuckle to myself at least.

It wouldn't have been as believable for Rie to run into the Labyrinth to save a business partner, for example. I also did a quick Google search on radiation poisoning, as I don't really know too much about the specifics. Wikipedia has a handy chart that shows which symptoms occur at different levels of radiation, and how long a person has to be exposed before they start showing said symptoms. Rie shows pretty consistent signs of radiation poisoning at around the 2-6 Gy exposure level. I don't know if that's what you were going for, or even if that's an accurate level (there are a lot of",

I heard talk about money, but again they had very thick accents. When the first man came back in, he explained what was going on and how I was a part of the identity black market. The",

Finally after all this time he is beginning to change their minds. The doctor strode into his office, a calm, complete stride that he had adopted working in the mental facility. No physical uncertainty translated to no mental uncertainty - and he needed that kind of protection working with the patients.

Determination, it was evident, to get out. \"Jesus\" the doctor drawled, his impatience lining his face. \"You must understand. I can not legally release you until you've proven to Ms. Sarah\"",

This effectively rendered Europe under German control. Years later the world would belong to Germany after a period of consolidating the assets of Europe to enhance the war machine.

Far above, he flew. Above the pool that churned with his fellows. Which, like all pools, was ever sullied with the excrement of the lazy and lame. But my albatross soared. He dazzled, he shone, he smiled, he laughed. Oh how he laughed. Always first, his contagious guffaws, and by the time you got the joke, he'd already flown away. For he made wings of his fins and claimed a domain of his own. Grifting and hustling his way from the docks to the airport, and from the airport the rest of the world. He called it his oyster, which I forgave, for he called *me* his pearl. And a pearl I was. For really, what is a pearl at its heart but a grain of presumptuous trash?",

Suddenly it wasn't a select group of people choosing the deaths, a jury of executioners, it was the entire world. At 12:00pm EST, a single person in the world would drop dead from no discernible cause. The technology behind it was complex, a new order of probability theory made reality.

There was no possible scientific explanation for a disease that would make one dance, of all things, whenever music was heard. It just made no sense.

It was when the kids joined in with their own version with their own interpretation of why . And they went on to take it everywhere and play in it . But in any case they took turns leading it and nobody else could do it ! So for two weeks straight we had to find people to lead us because so many of the members were in the parade and it was difficult to get them to march .

        "[ CC ] [ PI ] C764 ~ would really appreciate some crit for this piece . I find it a bit difficult to envision the setting . I know this piece was drawn with a great amount of care , but I just don 't see it in the game ! Also the art is a bit on the heavy side ( it would make some people mad ) , but it seems to work in the hands of an artist . Finally with the face of the main character , there is a strong sense of personality . The face seems to be really well detailed . I might find a different look for a hero or maybe give it a different context , but I don 't think it 's wrong . ( I know it 's not a perfect character , but I ' m sure I can make it something way better than what 's in the game [ CC ] : PI ) , but in general it works well here"
