"In 1954, major Serbian and Croatian writers, linguists and literary critics, backed by Matica srpska and Matica hrvatska signed the Novi Sad Agreement, which in its first conclusion stated: ""Serbs, Croats and Montenegrins share a single language with two equal variants that have developed around Zagreb (western) and Belgrade (eastern)"". The agreement insisted on the equal status of Cyrillic and Latin scripts, and of Ekavian and Ijekavian pronunciations. It also specified that Serbo-Croatian should be the name of the language in official contexts, while in unofficial use the traditional Serbian and Croatian were to be retained.

The occasion also contained an international conference on Slavic literature in France. During the conference there were many discussions on the ways in which the Serbian and Croatian literary traditions could serve as a bridge for the European literary project. The most significant among them was the conference held on 14-15th January 1959, in Paris between Srdja Trifunovic, the literary critic and leader of the Slovene Renaissance, and Jadranka Lajeva (later president-designate of the Council of Europe).

The Slovene Renaissance was a political movement and it took an active part in the formation of a new Slovenia.

"The Bush administration then turned its attention to Iraq, and argued the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq had become urgent. Among the stated reasons were that Saddam's regime had tried to acquire nuclear material and had not properly accounted for biological and chemical material it was known to have previously possessed, and believed to still maintain. Both the possession of these weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the failure to account for them, would violate the U.N. sanctions. The assertion about WMD was hotly advanced by the Bush administration from the beginning, but other major powers including China, France, Germany, and Russia remained unconvinced that Iraq was a threat and refused to allow passage of a UN Security Council resolution to authorize the use of force.

"An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in.

"Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism. Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies","Mammalian hair, also known as pelage, can vary in color between populations, organisms within a population, and even on the individual organism.

Such a hair appears on the face of one or both sides of the upper lip, under the chin, and is arranged in a ring around the eyes. The hairs are dark in color and are usually small.

In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of ""The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing"". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots ""philanthropic"" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such as Edmund Burke and","But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use.

In the 1780s, the term revolution (which de Montaigne used also) was associated with the French Revolution. Its modern use occurred in the late 1800s when anti-imperialist ideas took hold.

In it, the author reveals that the term ""revolution"" has been used in America in a variety of ways and is not always meant in the same sense today.

"Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional phenotype temperaments affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of genes and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. Zygotes require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every speciation event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring. In the five million years since the linages leading to modern humans and chimpanzees split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from","Emotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic physiology, particularly with the stress systems. This is important because emotions are related to the immune system (Jasanoff, 1975), and this system has an important impact on many diseases of the brain.

This study highlights the importance of emotion and social interaction in stress responses. Emotions are fundamental to biological processes and therefore may influence stress responses. In this context, several of the studies, including stress responses and inflammation in social interactions, showed that these effects were specific to socially stressful situations. It is likely that similar results occur in other types of stress response, such as those in the face of the financial crisis. Thus, the idea of emotional regulation and the effects of social interactions on stress response and inflammation might be modified.

To our knowledge, most of the studies investigating acute social stress responses have studied the stress response after a few days or weeks.

"Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper ""Human Genetic Diversity and the Nonexistence of Biological Races"". They find that the figure of 85% is misleading because it implies that all human populations contain on average 85% of all genetic diversity. They claim that this does not correctly reflect human population history, because it treats all human groups as independent. A more realistic portrayal of the way human groups are related is to understand that some human groups are parental to other groups and that these groups represent paraphyletic groups to their descent groups. For example, under the recent African origin theory the human population in Africa is paraphyletic to all other human groups because it represents the ancestral group from which all non-African populations derive, but more than that, non-African groups only derive from a small non-representative sample of this African population. This means that all non-African groups","Jeffrey Long and Rick Kittles give a long critique of the application of FST to human populations in their 2003 paper ""Human Genetic Diversity and the Implications for Biodiversity and Human Evolution,"" and they propose that we should use a ""convergent"" or ""mutationally relaxed"" FST.

Therefore, the number of genetic variants available for selection should correspond to a fixed population size.

Some individuals will be unable to breed as a result of adverse selection, so their FST falls above the fixed population size threshold. If an individual is not able to breed with any individual, it would be expected the FST would fall below the fixed population size threshold.

"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated ""favoured races"" as ""perfected races"", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867.

Darwin's own published translations are very clear and precise in their terminology, but they are still not a great deal more clear than the original. The best translation of the book ever was done by a Frenchman, M. De l'Amiral, who began English translations in the years after Darwin's death. Since then several others have followed in his footsteps, but I have not heard them speak as clearly as he did. This is because it is not always easy to convey simple definitions in English. (For example, what is a living entity, a living thing, or a living force in nature?)

But, while we can affirm Kant's conviction, we cannot accept the thesis that this human nature contains nothing more than ideas.

In addition to their disagreements in methodology and content, the two German Idealists disagreed in the nature of their ethical philosophy. This was partly because they were both convinced that ethics could only produce a set of dogmas. But partly it was because of the important role in their thought of that category of ideas called the ""Ideas of a People.""

Among the earliest cultural complexes of this area are the Sesklo culture in Thessaly, which later expanded in the Balkans giving rise to Starčevo-Körös (Cris), Linearbandkeramik, and Vinča. Through a combination of cultural diffusion and migration of peoples, the Neolithic traditions spread west and northwards to reach northwestern Europe by around 4500 BC.

The megalithic temple","In southeast Europe agrarian societies first appeared in the 7th millennium BC, attested by one of the earliest farming sites of Europe, discovered in the Neolithic village of Yohņa, Croatia. However, for most of recorded history, agriculture and foraging were inter-twined, in a way that still applies today, which is one of the main reasons why there have been significant and mutually beneficial relationships between modern humans and traditional (and sometimes even semi-modern) societies in general. A simple example of this is that of the domestication of plants, the introduction of cattle, and later the establishment of grain-based economies. In fact, early farmers and herders have been seen as the primary ancestors of our modern agricultural communities and in many cases have in fact become some of our most important predecessors in terms of cultural innovation and technological achievement.

"Knowledge, for Popper, was objective, both in the sense that it is objectively true (or truthlike), and also in the sense that knowledge has an ontological status (i.e., knowledge as object) independent of the knowing subject (Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach, 1972). He proposed three worlds: World One, being the physical world, or physical states; World Two, being the world of mind, or mental states, ideas, and perceptions; and World Three, being the body of human knowledge expressed in its manifold forms, or the products of the second world made manifest in the materials of the first world (i.e., books, papers, paintings, symphonies, and all the products of the human mind).

It can then be contrasted with other kinds of knowledge: ""What you know and don't know, what you want to know and what you don't, is a different affair; but whether you know or don't know is part of the same thing."" A further distinction between the two domains is of course made by Popper (and not, as some might have it, between scientific knowledge of the present state of affairs and knowledge of the truth of propositions in general).

It is often, in relation to the notion of fact, claimed that knowledge is what is'real', whereas mere opinion is a fiction. That, I think, is to miss the point just a little.

"Throughout the 14th century, French kings sought to expand their influence at the expense of the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327–77) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376),[AF] won the battles of Crécy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France.[AG] The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453.

They ran into difficulties when attempting to expand into the Netherlands (1515). A royal commission was established to monitor the activities of foreign merchants (1556) and by the end of the century French interests in the Netherlands had shrunk to a minimum (1568), even as French power spread into the lowlands of Europe (1627).

The most important of these changes was the development of the French empire from the 16th to the 19th century, and the end of the Renaissance. The reign of Charles VI (1610–14), which saw a series of civil wars and major rebellions, culminated in an unprecedented defeat by the forces of the Holy Roman Empire in 1648. However, much of the empire was left undefended when the Germans defeated the French at the Second Battle of Agincourt (1615) and drove the emperor from Europe.

The use of English for Jewish purposes by the English-speakers, particularly in Israel, has a long tradition extending to the period of the Inquisition of the 14th Century.[35] The English-speaking minority of Israel has been the key promoter of the development of a modern Hebrew language based on the language spoken in the country since ancient times; it is now used widely by the Jewish community. In the 19th Century the influence of western and eastern European modern languages, principally French, Spanish, English, German, and Russian, had been felt and, though the Hebrew language had its own contribution, the emphasis was primarily on improving the grammar as and on standardization of the various Hebrew dialects.

"The area now called Galicia was first inhabited by humans during the Middle Paleolithic period, and it takes its name from the Gallaeci, the Celtic peoples living north of the Douro river during the last millennium BC, in a region largely coincidental with that of the Iron Age local Castro culture. Galicia was incorporated into the Roman Empire at the end of the Cantabrian Wars in 19 BC, being turned into a Roman province in the 3rd century AD. In 410, the Germanic Suebi established a kingdom with its capital in Braga (Portugal) which was incorporated into that of the Visigoths in 585.

"Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow","Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. Birds also have an extraordinarily efficient respiration at low to mid altitudes that keeps their heart rates and respiration rates very consistent and slow without a substantial increase in energy expenditure. It is possible birds might have evolved efficient systems for oxygenating the tissues that would have helped them in the early days of their evolutionary development. The lungs of birds contain an unusual set of respiratory structures called ""bipodal"" or ""bony"" spiracles, the first of its kind in any arthropod, and an abundance of respiratory muscle tissue that allows flight and the ability to quickly control one's gait. While other large animals might have evolved a way to regulate their metabolic rate by reducing the surface area of their organs to reduce the surface area of their metabolizing body cells, most large animals require significantly more energy to run at the same speed as a","Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood ; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals . As a result , oxygen supply to the brain for any individual bird is ten times greater than the oxygen supply to any individual human . This is especially true of larger birds . The largest living bird in the world is ost riches with their brain having approximately half a liter more than human . This means that the oxygen provided by the blood to the ostrich 's brain is more than twice that received by the human nervous system. Because of this difference in the rate of oxygen diffusion into the blood , it 's estimated that the concentration of oxygen in a bird' s blood stream may be ten times that provided by the atmosphere to a human . This suggests not only an efficiency of oxygen absorption but also an incredibly high rate and variety of oxygen supply to each",5.88

"Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In other words, in an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are adolescents are liking to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. But, developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.[citation needed] Researchers have used three","Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents begin to ask probing questions and attempt to find an answer. As adolescents grow to develop into adults, the desire to have an identity becomes increasingly important.

As we move past adolescence and continue on into our adult years, identity development becomes even more important. We all strive to find what we are, and for most of us this quest will take many trips to the identity doctor and then a journey through numerous phases of denial.

You might have even been caught in a phase of denial of your sexual orientation.

Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity.

Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience.

"Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these male line ancestors appear to have been mainly Middle Eastern. For example, Ashkenazi Jews share more common paternal lineages with other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than with non-Jewish populations in areas where Jews lived in Eastern Europe, Germany and the French Rhine Valley. This is consistent with Jewish traditions in placing most Jewish paternal origins in the region of the Middle East. Conversely, the maternal lineages of Jewish populations, studied by looking at mitochondrial DNA, are generally more heterogeneous. Scholars such as Harry Ostrer and Raphael Falk believe this indicates that many Jewish males found new mates from European and other communities in the places where they migrated in the diaspora after fleeing ancient Israel. In contrast, Behar has found evidence that about 40% of Ashkenazi Jews originate maternally from just four female founders, who were of Middle Eastern origin. The","Y DNA studies tend to imply a small number of founders in an old population whose members parted and followed different migration paths. In most Jewish populations, these founder events probably represent, at best, a very small subset of all the Jews. If they did represent a larger fraction (by 50%) of all the Jews, the most ancient Jewish ancestors likely began to appear about 10,000 years ago in Africa, with a substantial fraction of the Jewish gene pool coming from about 100,000 years ago (see Figure 1). This is somewhat less than the age of the first Jewish men from sub-Saharan Africa, so the evidence does not support the picture of a new migration from Africa to Europe and back. However, the new results add to the evidence for an ancient Jewish migration, and they help to eliminate the possibility that the most ancient Jews were a people who began their spread and admixture around the time of the Exodus (12,500 years ago).

The state was able to survive through the Reform War with support from many nobles. It was a time of a rapid economic growth in the province.

The Reform War and the Civil War years

The Reform War broke out in 1840. A popular uprising was planned to retake Ayutla where the governor remained in exile on St. Dominic's Island (later renamed Capitula de la Patria), which lies in the Gulf of Punta Cana. After the failure of this revolt, military power began to rise in the region. The French military defeated the uprising after a bloody struggle. After the French victory, the Republic held a referendum that called on all citizens to vote in favor of independence in October 1851. French colonial rule in Ayutla ended that afternoon (November 11th) and the first government was elected on January 1st, 1852.

After the defeat of","The state united behind the Plan of Ayutla and ratified the new constitution in 1855 .

"In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose ""anything but intercourse"" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21. Multrine also states in her article","In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse, isolation) and sexual promiscuity, are often overcome by social and psychological supports, adolescents exposed to abuse by parents, siblings, a babysitter or a peer are more likely to become victimizers themselves to avoid the consequences of having been abused. This includes suicide or attempting suicide (13) and is a potential focus for prevention efforts in communities.

While many of us might think that adolescents are a risk group for substance abuse, more than 2.8 million of us have an alcohol use disorder, the vast majority of whom are in their late teens (10)–young adults (14). More than 500,000 adolescent females have an eating disorder and as much as 200,000 adolescent females are diagnosed as clinically depressed (15–17) despite the fact that only 10% of all teenagers are currently receiving treatment for depression (18).","In contemporary society , adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform .

There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico.

"The body’s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented. Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed. Once born, a child’s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides. In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas. In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited. For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult. Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns. This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact","The body’s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented.

When the antibody is capable of killing allergen, immunosuppression, which can be temporary or lifelong, occurs in the lymphocytes of the infected individual. After the immunosuppression has gone through with the lymphocytes, the antibody or its production is no longer necessary for eradication of the antigen(s) present in the body. The lymphocytes can then be recycled and the body can eliminate the specific antigen(s) without the presence of an antigen.

"Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae","Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of ammonia.


Many vertebrates, such as salamanders, lagomorphs - a group of extinct mammals - have no uric acids. Instead their high uric acid content is taken up in a form similar to urea, used to produce urea which then converts to urochromes and urea-glucuronide. So a carnivore (or other obligate carnivore, since that usually relies on blood to survive) will always have a high concentration of urea-based proteins even if it has no uric acid.


In birds, the most common uric acid is chystrale, which is found in about 80 and 75 percent of the birds tested. The other uric acid is uric acid, which is made by birds at an even higher concentration.

Stalin immediately directed Molotov to ""purge the ministry of Jews."" Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers. The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany.

The period, as is well known, also saw the birth of the Bolshevik Party's campaign against Zionism, the founding of the Jewish Anti-Defamation League (JAFL), the persecution of Russian nationalists and the mass deportation of Jews from the Pale of Settlement.

"When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone","When Nintendo released the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately different from that of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of the other consoles and thus the NES was visually different from the other consoles, even when it was meant for one common machine. The reason for these design differences is that the NES had a dual core CPU from another company (see: Seiko 3) at the same time that other consoles were based on a single core CPU.

The Sega Master System and Mega Drive were made in Japan while the 16-bit consoles were made in America. However, due to the fact that this was not technically feasible the Master System was manufactured with just one core.

"In Homer's Iliad, the names Danaans (or Danaoi: Δαναοί) and Argives (Argives: Αργείοι) are used to designate the Greek forces opposed to the Trojans. The myth of Danaus, whose origin is Egypt, is a foundation legend of Argos. His daughters Danaides, were forced in Tartarus to carry a jug to fill a bathtub without a bottom. This myth is connected with a task that can never be fulfilled (Sisyphos) and the name can be derived from the PIE root *danu: ""river"". There is not any satisfactory theory on their origin. Some scholars connect Danaans with the Denyen, one of the groups of the sea peoples who attacked Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III (1187-1156 BCE). The same inscription mentions the Weshesh who might have been the Achaeans. The Denyen seem to have been inhabitants of the city Adana in Cilicia.

During the first great wave of the Indo-European expansion from ca. 1600 bc to 300 bc, the Danaans were part of this demographic wave.

"By March 2011, the market share of OS X in North America had increased to slightly over 14%. Whether the size of the Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole.

The most likely explanation for the Mac's slow sales and disappointing results was the strong demand for Windows laptops among consumers.

The treaty was widely celebrated by Texans and their supporters, who considered the land given to Mexico by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo as part of a free and newly discovered country, while the Mexicans viewed the land given to Texas as an unaccepted and unauthorized concession to a foreign army.

The loss of Gaddafi's wealth and his own personal power made the Libyan leader fearful for his own life, and he began to focus on his opposition to Gadaffi. In a series of speeches at his homes and the Libyan parliament, Gaddafi attempted to promote the idea that people in the western Sahara should be given autonomy or the return of their territory to Libya. Though these arguments would go unheeded in Washington and London, they gave Gaddafi an international stage from which to criticize other Arab states and to call for closer Arab-Libyan relations in a show of independence.

"From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and the range of coupling of the fundamental forces. Feynman attempted an explanation of the strong interactions governing nucleons scattering called the parton model. The parton model emerged as a complement to the quark model developed by his Caltech colleague Murray Gell-Mann. The relationship between the two models was murky; Gell-Mann referred to Feynman's partons derisively as ""put-ons"". In the mid-1960s, physicists believed that quarks were just a bookkeeping device for symmetry numbers, not real particles, as the statistics of the Omega-minus particle, if it were interpreted as three identical strange quarks bound together, seemed impossible if quarks were real. The Stanford linear accelerator deep inelastic scattering experiments of the late 1960s showed, analogously to Ernest Rutherford's experiment of scattering alpha particles on gold nuclei in 1911, that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons.","From his diagrams of a small number of particles interacting in spacetime, Feynman could then model all of physics in terms of the spins of those particles and calculate the motion of all the world's particles according to a complex mathematical formula. At first, Feynman never succeeded in the precise calculations he needed to prove his theorem to the satisfaction of his advisor, who found that they needed quite a lot of work. Then, in 1953, Feynman had an extraordinary realization: that he could solve this problem as completely as possible while in the midst of doing experiments—because of his mathematical ideas about interactions and field theory.

Fearing the public reaction of those not willing to believe him at first, despite his excellent mathematical calculations, Feynman turned to the world to try and convince them.

The study states that the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Near East (i.e., they were non-Israelite), nor were they recruited in the Caucasus (i.e., they were non-Khazar), but instead they were assimilated within Europe, primarily of Italian and Old French origins.

"The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity. Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem. Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence. ""Barometric self-esteem"" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence. The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience. Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low","The final major aspect of identity formation is self-esteem. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and self-esteem and how others perceive those concepts and feels about oneself. While a person's self-concept is important in defining one's identity it is not the only factor. Many times people define their identity by comparing themselves to other people in their lives. Some research has shown that identity formation is influenced by children's attitudes from the time they're children where they are given a new label. If children are given a new label then they will define themselves as being better and better because of that label. This allows their mind to be used to make sense of the world for them. However, other research studies show that identity is the result of a person's beliefs toward themselves and others. When children believe their value is tied to how good they are, their self-esteem is likely to drop.

John died leaving the kingdom in the hands of his two eldest sons: James (1st James I, c1750-1812), son of the first wife of Peter III, a Scottish lord, James I, king after James I had ruled briefly under the name of James II, from 1803-1804, and George (James II, c1812-1822). [49] [50]

"Scotland, meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom. In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England, and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and","Scotland, meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom. In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England, and consequently the Crown of Scotland was formally detached from the Crown of England, thus ending the last period of Royal St. Andrews. Scotland's independence finally came to an end in 1803, however, when James VI of Scotland and his wife Elizabeth I of England gave up their crown and established the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Some argue this was not a successful union, and the last Crown Prince, James Douglas, refused to take up the title of King of Scotland and gave up on the Crown.

Scotland's history has been fascinating with many different factions all vying for power. In fact, Scotland became more divided than ever, with the Scottish National Party, the Scottish Green Party, and the Scottish Socialists all competing for power in the early 20th century.

"When John's elder brother Richard became king in September 1189, he had already declared his intention of joining the Third Crusade. Richard set about raising the huge sums of money required for this expedition through the sale of lands, titles and appointments, and attempted to ensure that he would not face a revolt while away from his empire. John was made Count of Mortain, was married to the wealthy Isabel of Gloucester, and was given valuable lands in Lancaster and the counties of Cornwall, Derby, Devon, Dorset, Nottingham and Somerset, all with the aim of buying his loyalty to Richard whilst the king was on crusade. Richard retained royal control of key castles in these counties, thereby preventing John from accumulating too much military and political power, and, for the time being, the king named the four-year-old Arthur of Brittany as the heir to the throne.

As part of this new army, John was appointed as the Grand Master of the Order of Preachers (or 'Order of Preachers') – an order of knighthood created under King Henry II to aid the crusaders in spreading Christianity and fighting the Muslims. John, however, had rejected the order, claiming that the 'holy men' of the Middle Ages had failed to accomplish their task of spreading Christianity and fighting the Muslims. Instead, he hoped to use his talents for preaching.

Inventor Johannes Kepler (1471–1543) is credited with introducing the idea of an ""arm on the harp to accompany the rhythm,"" which he would further develop in his work ""Metaphysica.""

It was not until 1844 that composers made the first concerted moves to record themselves on woodwind, a development that would not take place again for about 100 years.

Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power. Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $US 4.33 billion loan (US$56 billion in 2012) from the United States, the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006.

The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism.

The","Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the Second World War, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe had been devastated by war and its post-war political and social upheavals. Yet the British remained deeply committed to empire, as did most of the European countries. Although Britain had never won a war on home soil, she had been at least as successful at projecting power. Britain's military and economic might provided the United States with a new base to project its imperial ambitions upon. In the decades leading up to the Second World War, Britain's military was transformed, primarily through the efforts of a handful of men at the Ministry of Munitions and of many others at the home front.

[20] The Han dynasty, in contrast, was marked by instability and instability in succession. Although the emperor was not physically invested in power, at all times the legitimacy and strength of the dynasty rested on the ability to ensure that an emperor would rise in the afterlife—and the ability to provide for the dynastic interests of the emperor's descendents.

"A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science,","A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., emotional violence), individual characteristics (e.g., depression), and interpersonal patterns (e.g., interpersonal problems), in which the first two dimensions represent individual behavioral constructs and the interpersonal pattern dimensions are seen as defining personal behavior. In a similar vein, the emotions and disorders theory proposes that there are emotions and disorders which result from the complex interconnections among the three dimensions of emotions described thus far. Although not necessarily exclusive, there is growing evidence in the literature to suggest that, in some cases, only one of the dimensions of emotions is considered important within the field.

This interdependence of individual behavioral constructs that can coactivate or interact with each other has been found to hold true for mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders. As indicated previously, individual dimensions of personality characterize the way individuals respond to stress and to other people","A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels ( e.g. , anger , pride , fear , sympathy , shame ) that describe the underlying emotional experience .

"The United States has become essentially a two-party system. Since a conservative (such as the Republican Party) and liberal (such as the Democratic Party) party has usually been the status quo within American politics. The first parties were called Federalist and Republican, followed by a brief period of Republican dominance before a split occurred between National Republicans and Democratic Republicans. The former became the Whig Party and the latter became the Democratic Party. The Whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new Republican Party, as did anti-slavery members of the Democratic Party. Third parties (such as the Libertarian Party) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. Despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win (such as Theodore Roosevelt in the election of 1912 and George Wallace in the election of 1968).

"Darwin was hard at work on his ""big book"" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that ""your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled"" and he would ""of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal"" that Wallace chose, adding that ""all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed"".

It was the first letter they had ever received from each other. This letter revealed an extraordinary relationship between Darwin and Wallace. Here are a few things that we learned that Darwin found out by reading Wallace's letter:

In one letter Wallace mentions the possibility of spontaneous mutation.

The natural selection theory proposed by Darwin was based on both ""junk"" and ""workable"" concepts, i.e., ""junk"" meaning ""not biologically significant or useful, i.e., non-functional but useful,"" whereas ""workable"" means ""useful.""

Darwin's concept of ""natural selection"" was different from Wallace's.

"Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research of the Middle Ages: natural philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy (and astrology), law, grammar and rhetoric. Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum, while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance of humanism for changing this state-of-affairs cannot be underestimated. Once humanist professors joined the university faculty, they began to transform the study of grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis. Humanist professors focused on the ability of students to write and speak with distinction, to translate and interpret classical texts, and to live honorable lives. Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts, as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importance of those texts. Professors of medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno, Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts.

In the university we also found, for the first time in European history, the beginnings of the modern university, the universities of the Middle Ages. In addition to these, in the ninth and tenth centuries, universities developed the new discipline of medicine and philosophy, where the natural philosophy which had been taught in the Middle Ages was taken upon university staff. These developments marked the decline of the medieval university and of the university's scientific teaching, or, the university's ""retirement to the countryside"".

A board-only organization's bylaws may even state that the organization does not have any membership, although the organization's literature may refer to its donors or service recipients as ""members""; examples of such organizations are Fairvote and the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.

The officers are entitled to veto changes to the bylaws and to provide the board with nonvoting financial assistance.

Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that ""losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.""

For example, menarche (the first menstrual period of a female), or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur. In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects.

There are at least three possible outcomes of this crisis:

Estonia will continue to rely on Russia for gas supplies, which means its transition to a market economy will remain lengthy, but it will allow the economy to begin to diversify into new regions. It will become a hub for IT services and high-tech manufacturing. Estonia will develop its economic ties with China and India, bringing it into close cooperation with those nations, and eventually aligning with the West.

Estonia's current leaders will not be deterred, but instead will seek to resolve Russia's influence in their country and make the country the center of its own sphere of influence in Central Europe.","Since re-establishing independence , Estonia has styled itself as the gateway between East and West and aggressively pursued economic reform and integration with the West .

"Hidalgo is hailed as the Father of the Nation even though it was Agustin de Iturbide and not Hidalgo who achieved Mexican Independence in 1821. Shortly after gaining independence, the day to celebrate it varied between September 16, the day of Hidalgo's Grito, and September 27, the day Iturbide rode into Mexico City to end the war. Later, political movements would favor the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide, so that eventually September 16, 1810 became the officially recognized day of Mexican independence. The reason for this is that Hidalgo is considered to be ""precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the (Mexican War of) Independence.""

His efforts made the Mexican American war a cause of national excitement and inspired many Mexican patriots to rise up against Mexico's corrupt political system and republican government.

"Although the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians, it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary ""prepurified"" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem. In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was ""purified"" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally ""holier than all 'Men' born of woman"" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero. Sophronius' teaching is augmented and incorporated by St. John Damascene (d. 749/750).

After the Council, the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception remained central to the Church's teaching, particularly in regard to the ordination of women. It went even further in a number of places than in the Declaration, especially in places where it seemed, as did Cardinal Ratzinger, that the ordination of women was ""impossible"".

"The political structure of Western Europe changed with the end of the united Roman Empire. Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as ""invasions"", they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire. Such movements were aided by the refusal of the western Roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration. The emperors of the 5th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho (d. 408), Aspar (d. 471), Ricimer (d. 472), or Gundobad (d. 516), who were partly or fully of non-Roman background. When the line of western emperors ceased, many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background. Intermarriage between the new kings and the Roman elites was common. This led to a fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes, including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in","The political structure of Western Europe changed with the end of the united Roman Empire. Although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as ""inherited"", the fact is that the Roman republic was a form of government. Unlike the American constitution, the constitution of the Roman empire was a legal document enforced by the militia. This militia-based form of state action remained the basic framework of government for the Romans for the next several hundred years. This period saw further transformations in the structure of the states themselves.

In the years following the collapse of the republic which had been founded by Julius Caesar's conquests in AD 43, Rome was ruled by a series of dictatorships which were the product of the political conflicts between different communities of elites, a process that was to continue for 300 years.

Outside of these commonalities, great differences separated north and south, primarily in subject matter. Italian universities focused on law and medicine, while the northern universities focused on the arts and theology.

The best approach was to re-check the records and remove any worn or poorly pressed spots. To avoid a sticky and unwieldy glue, records that show any signs of this are best given a quick wipe-clean, before carefully removing any residue that may have caught on to the disc. However, the glue can be removed using a thin, oil-based cleaner, such as acetone.

Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. With contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis, promotion of scholarship and learning and the strong propensity to promote cultivation of intellectual pursuits as well as the nations high university educational attainment rate exemplifies how highly Israeli society values higher education. The Israeli","Education in Israel is highly valued in the national culture with its historical values dating back to Ancient Israel and was viewed as one fundamental blocks of ancient Israelite nation. At the same time, the Jewish cultural identity of Israeli society as a whole does not want to give up the ""old"" identity of Israelite culture.

In the wake of the Arab revolutions, many groups and schools of thought attempted to ""un-Jew Israel"", with the goals to de-emphasize her cultural and historical elements.

From the perspective of Jewish nationalism, the way to achieve this goal is to ""defund"" the Jewish state in its entirety until she either gives up her Jewish identity or is replaced by some other ""non-Jew"". Therefore, the ""Jewish State"" policy is designed to deflate Jewish nationalism and replace it with its main enemy: the ""non -Jew"". This is done by using the fear of ""Israelism"" or ""non -Jewishness"" of the ""other","Education in Israel is highly valued in the national culture with its historical values dating back to Ancient Israel and was viewed as one fundamental blocks of ancient Israelite life .

"Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin continued to take an interest in the French religious affairs from his base in Geneva. He regularly trained pastors to lead congregations there. Despite heavy persecution, the Reformed tradition made steady progress across large sections of the nation, appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment. French Protestantism came to acquire a distinctly political character, made all the more obvious by the conversions of nobles during the 1550s. This established the preconditions for a series of conflicts, known as the French Wars of Religion. The civil wars gained impetus with the sudden death of Henry II of France in 1559. Atrocity and outrage became the defining characteristics of the time, illustrated at their most intense in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of August 1572, when the Roman Catholic party annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across","Protestantism also spread from the German lands into France, where the Protestants were nicknamed Huguenots. Calvin continued to take an interest in the state of his Protestant subjects, even though it was not in his primary interest to do so. Under the terms of his agreement with Charles IX, the elector of Hainault, and in order to placate the other Protestant princes, Calvin was allowed to retain many of his most eminent scholars while all the other Protestants were forced to pay tribute. One such outstanding scholar was the historian Jacques de Thou, who wrote the famous work, the ""History of the French Reformation"" (1631-36). This book, an outstanding work, was first translated into Latin in 1638 by the Dominican Father Francois Dezsel. After its original publication under the name of De Thou, de Thou published another edition and in 1638 published a third edition with new material. De Thou had written,

"Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past,","Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence on the family or society as a whole. Some children exhibit greater maturity in their behavior during this period, sometimes displaying a more assertive nature and sometimes growing weary of household chores, socializing, or other duties that are expected of them.

Children enter maturity between the ages of 10 and 15. They develop and increase in physical strength and begin to develop social maturity. During this time the child must learn life lessons that provide them with the tools for self-fulfillment. These lessons are best learned through observation of other children and their parents, and by playing the role that is given to the child.

The Role of the Adolescent

"The late 1980s saw a series of liberalising economic reforms within Libya designed to cope with the decline in oil revenues. In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the start of the ""Revolution within a Revolution"", which began with reforms to industry and agriculture and saw the re-opening of small business. Restrictions were placed on the activities of the Revolutionary Committees; in March 1988, their role was narrowed by the newly created Ministry for Mass Mobilization and Revolutionary Leadership to restrict their violence and judicial role, while in August 1988 Gaddafi publicly criticised them, asserting that ""they deviated, harmed, tortured"" and that ""the true revolutionary does not practise repression.""

In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the nationalisation of all oil producing assets at a cut-price of $26 per barrel.

In December, Gaddafi's former interior minister, Ibrahim Hadiyah, announced that the government would not let the black market operate in the oil industry. While the government claimed that this was in response to calls from the OPEC oil producers, they were probably acting out of fear because they feared they would lose profits from exports.

A major concern of continental philosophy lies with problems of the first-person, so it could, plausibly, be assumed that a first-person perspective on reality would be coherent and illuminating.

However, the logical relations among the different possible ""standpoints"" of reality are themselves difficult to explain. The problems with a first-person perspective can be summarized as follows:

"Initially, the Turkish Cypriots favoured the continuation of the British rule. However, they were alarmed by the Greek Cypriot calls for enosis as they saw the union of Crete with Greece, which led to the exodus of Cretan Turks, as a precedent to be avoided, and they took a pro-partition stance in response to the militant activity of EOKA. The Turkish Cypriots also viewed themselves as a distinct ethnic group of the island and believed in their having a separate right to self-determination from Greek Cypriots. Meanwhile, in the 1950s, Turkish leader Menderes considered Cyprus an ""extension of Anatolia"", rejected the partition of Cyprus along ethnic lines and favoured the annexation of the whole island to Turkey.

However, they were alarmed by the Greek Cypriot calls for enosis, and by the strong Greek nationalist movements, which threatened to drive the Turks out from their homes. Hence, they accepted the British proposal in early 1920. To make sure that the Cypriot administration was friendly towards the British, George IV agreed to pay the island of Rhodes up to a certain sum. This sum was eventually paid by Great Britain, and was to be distributed out proportion to the number of Greeks who migrated to Cyprus. But this was only half done, for by this time the Cypriots had their own political organisation called the Ekklesi. This was headed by the Greek-speaking nationalist Nikaia Anastasiadou.

"The European concept of ""race"", along with many of the ideas now associated with the term, arose at the time of the scientific revolution, which introduced and privileged the study of natural kinds, and the age of European imperialism and colonization which established political relations between Europeans and peoples with distinct cultural and political traditions. As Europeans encountered people from different parts of the world, they speculated about the physical, social, and cultural differences among various human groups. The rise of the Atlantic slave trade, which gradually displaced an earlier trade in slaves from throughout the world, created a further incentive to categorize human groups in order to justify the subordination of African slaves. Drawing on Classical sources and upon their own internal interactions — for example, the hostility between the English and Irish powerfully influenced early European thinking about the differences","The European concept of ""race"", along with many of the ideas now associated with the term, arose at the time of the scientific revolution, which introduced the notion of natural selection - the idea that traits are inherited by descent. As with many cultural theories, the theory was later discredited, particularly in the 20th century, when evolutionary theory replaced it.

However, many modern-day Americans think of race as hereditary, with specific genetic differences between different races. People have been fascinated by claims that whites have evolved white skin through the process of selective breeding, while East Asians often have dark skin due to the fact that they had darker skin in their original homeland. Recent research has also shown that our DNA could be viewed as a mixture of European and African DNA, with many areas of the genome potentially influenced by both.","The European concept of `` race '' , along with many of the ideas now associated with the term , arose at the time of the scientific revolution , which occurred in the seventeenth century .

The new standards had little room for an `` animus `` in the human soul. As a result , the notion of `` race `` disappeared , in the sense of `` type `` .

"The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), for supremacy in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon.

"Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free period, plenty of sunshine, and a moderate rainfall, usually from 600 to 1,200 mm (24 to 47 in). Soils usually need to be fairly heavy, although the level of nutrients does not need to be exceptional. In general, these conditions are met within the seasonally dry tropics and subtropics in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but a large proportion of the cotton grown today is cultivated in areas with less rainfall that obtain the water from irrigation. Production of the crop for a given year usually starts soon after harvesting the preceding autumn. Cotton is naturally a perennial but is grown as an annual to help control pests. Planting time in spring in the Northern hemisphere varies from the beginning of February to the beginning of June. The area of the United States known as the South Plains is the largest contiguous cotton-growing region in the world. While dryland (non-irrigated) cotton is successfully grown in this region, consistent yields are only produced with heavy","Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free period, plenty of sunshine, and a moderate rainfall, usually from 600 to 1,200 mm (24-36 inches) a year, with the soil moisture not being too much reduced as has often occurred in the past, but too great a degree of moisture being retained in the root system. The moisture of the soil is determined in turn by its location; for the root system, once established in an infir- mated position, will continue its work with or without the necessary amount of moisture. ""From the beginning the importance of adequate moisture in cultivation as a factor in the final outcome is apparent. The high percentage of moisture of the first flush of leaves on the cotton is in many respects a sign of great health and of early and vigorous maturity. At this time the cotton must be so thoroughly dried and compacted that it will resist a vigorous tearing from the seed while remaining pliable and yielding under strain. When the plants are sufficiently","Successful cultivation of cotton requires a long frost-free period , plenty of sunshine , and a moderate rainfall , usually from 600 to 1,200 mm ( 24 to 47 in ) a year .

"Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the ""purification"" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of ""purification"" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as ""prokathartheisa (prepurified)."" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of","Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of antiquity, since most of them held that the body of Mary, or the body of the infant Jesus (although she could be conceived in several ways), was entirely and forever exempt from all stain or defect of sin. It was in this way that they believed that she alone was pure from the seed of Adam. In the earliest Christian documents, it is assumed that Mary was assumed into the heavenly realm by Jesus (Matt. 1:23, John 1:30). (It is impossible to escape the conclusion that early Christians regarded Mary and Jesus as one and the same person. As Jerome puts it, ""It would be very strange if that one were also God, since He had, after the divine manner, begotten a son."")

So while the Turkish national movement has moved more and more in the direction of nationalism and Islamism, the question of the Ottoman medrese-kultum remains unsolved. As the new generation of Istanbul intellectuals and intellectuals of the liberal side of politics has become increasingly religious in their stance, and as many progressive and rational Islamic scholars have moved in the same direction, there is a growing doubt among conservative Muslims who want to revive the Ottoman medrese-kultum.

An example of this is the use of a particular language by a newcomer in a room full of people speaking various languages.

"To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted to meet their dietary requirements in a variety of ways. Some eat other animals – this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants. A herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as fruit-eating and grass-eating. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract, because the proteins, lipids, and minerals found in meat require little in the way of specialized digestion. Plants, on the other hand, contain complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose. The digestive tract of an herbivore is therefore host to bacteria that ferment these substances, and make them available for digestion. The bacteria are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum.

"To prevent the risk of out-of-phase supplies mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is achieved by Neutral Sections (also known as Phase Breaks), usually provided at feeder stations and midway between them although, typically, only half are in use at any time, the others being provided to allow a feeder station to be shut down and power provided from adjacent feeder stations. Neutral Sections usually consist of an earthed section of wire which is separated from the live wires on either side by insulating material, typically ceramic beads, designed so that the pantograph will smoothly run from one section to the other. The earthed section prevents an arc being drawn from one live section to the other, as the voltage difference may be higher than the normal system voltage if the live sections are on different phases and the protective circuit breakers may not be able to safely interrupt the considerable current that would flow. To prevent the risk of an arc being drawn across from one","To prevent the risk of out-of-phase supplies mixing, sections of line fed from different feeder stations must be kept strictly isolated. This is particularly important for heavy oil deliveries. The equipment used at the line feeders are designed to keep the lines in phase. If these equipment fails, the oil could be exposed to a large degree of error.

All lines must carry the same tank capacity at all times. All the lines must be operated in a coordinated manner to ensure the right amount of oil is being delivered for the best possible quality.

It is particularly important that the pipelines from the pipeline to the storage tanks are kept in phase as a result of their design. It is believed that the best place for the pumps for pumping at least 4 and up to 24 000 gallons of oil is at a designated location for the line feeders in order to assure that they are at the right temperature according to the feeder station they are connected to.

"The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual.

So worried were the Government over the sudden campaign of leaflets and posters distributed by the Communist Party in Coventry and London, that the Police were sent in to seize their production facilities. The Government, up until November 1940, was opposed to the centralised organisation of shelter. Home Secretary Sir John Anderson was replaced by Morrison soon afterwards, in the wake of a Cabinet reshuffle as the dying Neville Chamberlain resigned. Morrison warned that he could not counter the Communist unrest unless provision of shelters were made. He recognised the right of the public to seize tube stations and authorised plans to improve their","In the wake of the Coventry Blitz, there was widespread agitation from the Communist Party over the need for bomb-proof shelters. Many Londoners, living in unassuming tenements with little protection, sought their own escape routes. They built underground shelters at the base of apartment buildings, or in their garages, often as temporary measures during the Blitz, only to have them quickly stripped by the authorities during the bombing. By the end of the war, they had taken more than 300,000 lives during the Blitz—more than all German combat deaths.[1]

""The building at 20, Albert Street, was a temporary shelter for the occupants of the nearby apartment block. It had no basement, walls, roof or windows.""

The Underground shelters were also known as ""bomb-proof shelters,"" or ""bomb-proof stoves."" Some of the shelters were in fact converted cellar stoves like the ones described in the poem ""A Room with an Arrow Slit"" by John","In the wake of the Coventry Blitz , there was widespread agitation from the Communist Party over the need for bomb-proof shelters .

In 1947 the committee published its findings, To Secure These Rights.

Truman, himself a combat veteran of World War I, issued Executive Order 9808 establishing the Armed Forces Radio Broadcast Service in June 1942.

Truman's order required all military members to establish and maintain radio stations, to receive regular transmissions from Army units operating in various theaters of operation, to transmit such transmissions, and, of course, to transmit them, not only as a military broadcast but also for their general dissemination through civilian stations and wire services. By issuing his orders, Truman committed the U.S. Army to the radio project.

Despite the war efforts, the radio broadcast service proved to be less efficient than the wire service. This was due to a number of factors, including Army officials' insistence that Army units be authorized to transmit over the radio, without having to first obtain approval from the State Governors. The service also faced logistical difficulties--radio transmission equipment was of poor quality and many stations experienced technical difficulties.

"Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom. Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521). In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person. The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state. In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom. Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance. Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews.

Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther's time. The Catholic reformers did not tolerate, but rather embraced, this fundamental human right. In fact, the reformers understood the Christian religion to be a universal form of religion for all mankind. For Protestants, the Protestant faith held the potential to unite the world's peoples in a shared spiritual world. This idea resonated deeply with the Lutherans.

As a result of Luther's bold stance, the Catholic reformers were forced to give up much of the autonomy they had enjoyed during the Middle Ages. The first Protestant church did not have to adhere to the strict separation of church and state that characterized church-state relations in pre-modern Europe. In fact, Protestant churches maintained some official autonomy in their handling of local affairs.

The papacy did not welcome this new status quo. At least one Protestant preacher, Peter Abel","Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom .

Under Gaddafi, Libya won independence in 2011 and was one of the most advanced countries of the Arab Spring.

His regime faced brutal repression and death squads when he was ousted in 2012, with NATO forces now being attacked for bombing the city of Sirte, home to a number of Gaddafi's sons and other senior officials.

"In 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, Charles II of England granted William Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony. Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, in what is now the city's Fishtown section. Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for brotherly love (from philos, ""love"" or ""friendship"", and adelphos, ""brother""). As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, far more than afforded by most other colonies, led to better relations with the local Native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city. Penn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia","In 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, Charles II of England granted William Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony. Despite the loss of the Great Charter following a series of rebellions, Penn continued to seek new tracts of land. With the help of Pennsylvania legislators, like the Honorable Nathaniel Bradford, he acquired two tracts near Plymouth and another near Philadelphia.

The Treaty of London on April 29, 1691 placed responsibility for paying the debts of the Dutch colony with the French colony. The payment was intended to satisfy the colonists who had protested against payment. After a series of violent raids, in 1692 Penn agreed to cede to the settlers in his lands four of the eight parcels that had been ceded by his predecessor.

In 1693 Penn signed the Treaty of Paris. The next year, Penn's father, Sir John Penn, was born in Holland. The Penns came to North America later that year, sailing from England with the first colonists.","In 1681 , in partial repayment of a debt , Charles II of England granted William Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony .

While many have come to this conclusion after reviewing this article, a majority of the Watchtower's members probably first heard this doctrine in 1908.

At a lecture given by H. J. Piggott on October 31, 1906 titled ""The End Is Rapidly Approaching"" (the speaker was quoted from a copy of the speech in the Watchtower of November 3, 1907 and this book contains the text of the lecture also), this was mentioned:

The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration played an important role in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide.

Instead, the study of geography shows that, like a fingerprint, the flora and fauna of a region can be predicted for a range of environmental conditions due to the effect of topography and the climate on plant and animal populations. For example, in the New World tropics, most mammal species live in dense forests, with few plants and a low biodiversity.

It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep.

From the point of view of the Seleucid rulers, they were not concerned with the identities of their subjects; rather they were concerned with the wealth and power that was contained within the land.

"“The roots of all our modern academic fields can be found within the pages of literature.” Literature in all its forms can be seen as written records, whether the literature itself be factual or fictional, it is still quite possible to decipher facts through things like characters’ actions and words or the authors’ style of writing and the intent behind the words. The plot is for more than just entertainment purposes; within it lies information about economics, psychology, science, religions, politics, cultures, and social depth. Studying and analyzing literature becomes very important in terms of learning about our history.

"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the ""Forty acres and a mule"" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F.

As I wrote last month, it was these practices that led to the establishment of the federal government as a governing body. Instead of empowering blacks, the black code helped cement white supremacy by giving them control over state government resources and power.

"Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the ""non-breeding"" plumage, or—in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology—""basic"" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as ""alternate"" plumages. Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. Moulting patterns vary across species. In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap.","Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the ""non-breeding plumage"".

The feathers on the head and flanks, the talons and the beak (gizzard) are all considered part of the pre-breeding plumage and so must be removed, and sometimes a part of a bird that has moulted must be preserved to protect itself from predation.

It is thought that after breeding the sexes develop different plumage, because in early development, all other parts of the bird are covered with the same feather cells.

However, not all parts of the plumage are equally important in survival. The beak is thought to be one of the most important parts in pre-breeding plumage because of the importance of a beak to feeding, and to helping a bird keep a balance in balance between itself and the environment.

England however was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD, and eventually became a feudal possession of Denmark.

Most of these are oxidizers (i.e., acceptors of electrons) and some react very strongly. For the continued normal cellular maintenance, growth, and division, these free radicals must be sufficiently neutralized by antioxidant compounds. Recently, some researchers suggested an interesting theory of evolution of dietary antioxidants. Some are produced by the human body with adequate precursors (glutathione, Vitamin C), and those the body cannot produce may only be obtained in the diet via direct sources (Vitamin C in humans, Vitamin A, Vitamin K) or produced by the body from other compounds (Beta-carotene converted to Vitamin A by the body, Vitamin D synthesized from cholesterol by sunlight).

Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life.

Unfortunately, this kind of comparison is difficult to prove when it comes to Luther's writings. Some theologians claim that Luther's commentaries often include a list of supposed ""allusions"" in which he mentions ""saints"" and ""bishops,"" but there is no evidence that the Church Fathers were even aware of these references. In fact, some Church Fathers seem to make it very clear that they had no idea about Martin Luther's claims.

Their offer was to give equal rights to Hindus and Muslims within the existing British Indian empire, but for Curzon to get the Indians to accept this would require the British to give up control of India, which was seen as a threat to the interests of both the United Kingdom and Curzon himself.

The Shang were","The area of modern Zhejiang was outside the major sphere of influence of the Shang civilization during the second millennium BC . Instead , this area was populated by peoples from other parts of East Asia , who came into contact with Shang civilization through trade . It seems that their contact with Shang culture led them to adopt its religious ideas , but retained their own traditional views .

"Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks. One way of classifying predators is by trophic level. Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers. Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth. Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses). A predator at the top","Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators. Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be preyed upon themselves by other insects. This means that blue jays may even become preyed upon by other blue jays and so on. As the author describes in a footnote on pg. 26, it is ""an oddball example of interspecies warfare...""

Thus, in their case, perhaps it may be suggested that blue jays might ""famine"" for a period of several decades as their natural environment becomes too large for them. Perhaps if the blue jays were to become extremely numerous, their natural habitat would be destroyed and they would lose their natural range. This would be a problem for these blue jays, and the more that were killed en masse, the worse their plight would become. It might appear that the blue jays starve themselves over time by their own actions, but there is one catch.

Clubbers to The Warehouse were primarily black and gay, who came to dance to music played by the club's resident DJ Frankie Knuckles, whom fans refer to as the ""godfather of house"". After the Warehouse closed in 1983, the crowds went to Knuckles' new club, The Power Plant. In the Channel 4 documentary Pump Up The Volume, Knuckles remarks that the first time he heard the term ""house music"" was upon seeing ""we play house music"" on a sign in the window of a bar on Chicago's South Side.

"As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century. There were fewer invasions of the eastern section of the empire; most occurred in the Balkans. Peace with Persia, the traditional enemy of Rome, lasted throughout most of the 5th century. The Eastern Empire was marked by closer relations between the political state and Christian Church, with doctrinal matters assuming an importance in eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe. Legal developments included the codification of Roman law; the first effort—the Theodosian Code—was completed in 438. Under Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), another compilation took place—the Corpus Juris Civilis. Justinian also oversaw the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and the reconquest of North Africa from the Vandals and Italy from the Ostrogoths, under Belisarius (d. 565). The conquest of Italy was not complete, as a deadly outbreak of plague in 542","As Western Europe witnessed the formation of new kingdoms, the Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival that lasted into the early 7th century.

The new Chinese dynasties developed the trade, maritime and economic industries and established a culture that was considered by historians as quite advanced in comparison with the previous. This era began in the 16th century with the establishment of the Ming Dynasty in the Tang Dynasty by an influential dynasty.

"Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials. They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas, once common in the Eastern Mediterranean. The most superb example can be found in the bath house of Hisham's Palace, Palestine which was made around 744. The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer (right side) and two deers peacefully grazing (left side). The panel probably represents good and bad governance. Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in Anjar, Lebanon.

The main Islamic design was the so-called qanati, that is, an array of rectilinear, straight-faced pillars that stood above the floor. This was followed by the tiling of the roof which began with rectilinear pillars and arches. After these initial features were covered by a mosaic, the ceiling would be covered by mosaics with floral and geometric motifs. On the roof and ceiling, a pattern of black and white tiles known as kafan was very common. On the floors, carpet decoration was highly prized and covered many of the rooms.

It is also important to note that not all airlines are as fortunate as Air New Zealand and Qantas Australia where airports are being named after a long-established historical figure. Instead, a pilot may spend a significant amount of their time in flight waiting on a plane's departure time. This is often due to the frequent flight patterns of international aviation.

This was the largest national referendum conducted in Europe since the First World War. Ireland was one of the many countries to declare full independence in the wake of the First World War after the British Parliament passed the Irish Reputation and Loyalty Act. This act allowed a number of British subjects living in Ireland who had been convicted of treason to be deported to Australia where they would be interned as criminals.

The most interesting thing about copper is the amount of copper it contains, and the fact that it is a metal with a fairly high melting point. Copper is a metal with an extremely large amount of energy stored in it, and the heat produced during the melting process can be used to create electricity. One of the reasons why the Romans used copper rather than iron for their weapons was the fact that copper held a higher thermal conductivity compared to iron. A high heat transfer coefficient allowed more heat to be carried away in one direction, making the metal the ideal choice for weapons.

Brodie and Lutyens as members, submitted reports for both North and South sites. However, it was rejected by the Viceroy when the cost of acquiring the necessary properties was found to be too high. The central axis of New Delhi, which today faces east at India Gate, was previously meant to be a north-south axis linking the Viceroy's House at one end with Paharganj at the other. During the project's early years, many tourists believed it was a gate from Earth to Heaven itself. Eventually, owing to space constraints and the presence of a large number of heritage sites in the North side, the committee settled on the South site. A site atop the Raisina Hill, formerly Raisina Village, a Meo village, was chosen for the Rashtrapati Bhawan, then known as the Viceroy's House. The reason for this","Soon Lutyens started considering other places. Indeed, the Delhi Town Planning Committee, set up to plan the new imperial capital, with George Swinton as its chairman, was interested in the idea of giving Delhi a world class airport. The Delhi airport, which was set to be on a 1,600 acre site, would have been the largest airport in the world. The site was located just a few kilometres away from the parliament and was earmarked for high-rise office buildings.

As Delhi did not have any major airport then and the location of the new airport was found to be a disadvantage, it was decided to transfer the airport to Ahmedabad, which was the second most populous city in India. The Delhi airport building had to be demolished, partly because of its location and partly due to its architecture. It was decided to build a replacement complex in the same design as the existing Ahmadabad airport. This was to be the Ahmadabad aviation hub.

Although this rule change has been long anticipated, some ISPs, such as Comcast and AT&T have pushed behind the scenes ever since as to how it might affect their services. To be able to sell their customers' data, the FCC will therefore need to consider a number of relevant factors.

"Different phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase , gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH","Different phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase.

The step 1 digestion reaction occurs between 16 hours and 24 hours after the intake of a meal in the cephalic phase ( ). The gastric acid reaction which begins about 4-6 hours after intake of a meal causes the breakdown of the first molecule of fiber in the gut and causes increased acid production that continues for 6-8 hours that then leads to the formation of bile which is then secreted into the colon which creates the absorptive capacity in the cephalic phase.

In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance. Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals. An important question is, ""do invasive species cause extinctions?"" Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives, but not extinctions.

They may not always do well in new habitats, and they can also encounter human health hazards, such as antibiotic-resistant diseases.

"In 1877, Thomas Edison invented the phonograph. Unlike the phonautograph, it was capable of both recording and reproducing sound. Despite the similarity of name, there is no documentary evidence that Edison's phonograph was based on Scott's phonautograph. Edison first tried recording sound on a wax-impregnated paper tape, with the idea of creating a ""telephone repeater"" analogous to the telegraph repeater he had been working on. Although the visible results made him confident that sound could be physically recorded and reproduced, his notes do not indicate that he actually reproduced sound before his first experiment in which he used tinfoil as a recording medium several months later. The tinfoil was wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder and a sound-vibrated stylus indented the tinfoil while the cylinder was rotated. The recording could be played back immediately.

Unlike the phonautograph, it was capable of both recording and reproducing sound. Despite the huge advances made throughout the century, the technology remained somewhat inefficient. The phonautographer was expensive, prone to malfunction and would require manual adjustments due to the poor quality of microphones and speaker combinations.

In 1927, J. P. Morgan and J. W. Carnegie had the idea to combine Edison's invention with other new technologies to create the first commercial computer. To create a sound recording of the same length as a human voice, a two-inch tape was mounted with a microphone to record audio with the voice. Using a reel-to-reel player, players would play a record using an electromagnet, which would rotate the tape along with the needle, resulting in recording sound. At this level of performance, the record could be sent across the radio frequency transmission spectrum by radio receivers, effectively creating a computer.

"Tensions over rising Polish nationalism and the economic effects of the Continental System led to renewed confrontation with Russia. To enforce his blockade, Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic collapse of the Grand Army, forcing the French to retreat, as well as leading to the widespread destruction of Russian lands and cities. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France. A chaotic military campaign in Central Europe eventually culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October. The next year, the Allies invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island of Elba. The Bourbons were restored to power and the French lost most of the territories that they had conquered since the Revolution. However, Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of the government once again. The Allies responded by forming","Tensions over rising Polish nationalism and the economic effects of the Continental System led to renewed confrontation with Russia. To enforce his blockade, Napoleon launched an invasion of the Russian Empire by sea during 1812: the campaign was a military disaster, and the failure to conquer Russia left the emperor vulnerable to the Russian army.

Napoleon's naval blockade against the United States resulted in the British and U.S. governments signing the Treaty of Ghent in October 1813 that ended the war and effectively ended both American presence in the Caribbean (having been forced to withdraw by Napoleon) and the maritime competition between France and Britain. In other words, this ended American independence in the Western Hemisphere as it once existed as a separate nation.

The treaty had the effect of ending American commercial rights in the entire North Atlantic, which also excluded the trade with the Caribbean, the West Indies Sea, the Persian Gulf and other territories. This was a major blow to European economic interests.

Hellen was the son of Deucalion who ruled around Phthia in central Greece. The Parian Chronicle mentions that when Deucalion became king of Phthia, the previously called Graikoi were named Hellenes. Aristotle notes that the Hellenes were related with Grai/Greeks (Meteorologica I.xiv) a native name of a Dorian tribe in Epirus which was used by the Illyrians. He also claims that the great deluge must have occurred in the region around Dodona, where the Selloi dwelt.

"In biology, energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living organism. Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle of a biological organism. Energy is thus often said to be stored by cells in the structures of molecules of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars), lipids, and proteins, which release energy when reacted with oxygen in respiration. In human terms, the human equivalent (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500 kJ per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e.

Napoleon saw his chance to recuperate the formerly wealthy colony when he signed the Treaty of Amiens. During the Revolution, the National Convention voted to abolish slavery in February 1794. Under the terms of Amiens, however, Napoleon agreed to appease British demands by not abolishing slavery in any colonies where the 1794 decree had never been implemented. The resulting Law of 20 May never applied to colonies like Guadeloupe or Guyane, even though rogue generals and other officials used the pretext of peace as an opportunity to reinstate slavery in some of these places.

"In January 1938, Milt Gabler started recording for his new label, Commodore Records, and to allow for longer continuous performances, he recorded some 12-inch records. Eddie Condon explained: ""Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development."" The first two 12-inch recordings did not take advantage of the extra length: ""Carnegie Drag"" was 3:15; ""Carnegie Jump"", 2:41. But at the second session, on April 30, the two 12-inch recordings were longer: ""Embraceable You"" was 4:05; ""Serenade to a Shylock"", 4:32.

This was called the ""Midnight Special.""

In a way, it's the classic recording for its time. Though Gabler uses a more technical approach than many sound men of the time, he still makes interesting use of the microphones and his own vocal stylings to create a story and, most importantly, capture the essence of the events taking place. There is a great deal of tension and mystery built into each recording. Here, he is in a small cottage; a very dangerous place to be at night. One minute he's out front; the next, up inside his own home. There's lots of very tense moments of negotiation, some shouting and much shouting. Most memorable is a shot of a woman screaming; an event that is of great importance to the characters in Gabler's stories.

"However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid. In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features:","However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a leaf. For example, if the leaf is dropping from a tree or from the top of a house, then the leaf falling will cause the falling tree or the falling house to collapse (if its base is weak enough). And from this the result follows that the leaf fell from god which leads one to ask the question of ""why god would allow the leaf to fall from a non-god""? And if the leaves fall from something which is a tree than the question ""why on earth would the leaf fall from the top of something which is not an actual tree"" also arises, this leads in two interesting directions.

I would also consider the question why God would allow the leaf to fall from something which is a tree (even the top of a tree), but never the other way around.

"The deliberate or accidental hybridising of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown in recent times for economic purposes. The number of successful interspecific mammalian hybrids is relatively small, although it has come to be known that there is a significant number of naturally occurring hybrids between forms or regional varieties of a single species.[citation needed] These may form zones of gradation known as clines. Indeed, the distinction between some hitherto distinct species can become clouded once it can be shown that they may not only breed but produce fertile offspring. Some hybrid animals exhibit greater strength and resilience than either parent. This is known as hybrid vigor. The existence of the mule (donkey sire; horse dam) being used widely as a hardy draught animal throughout ancient and modern history is testament to this.

"A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is the simple belief in God the Creator, with no reference to the Bible or any other miraculous source. Instead, the Deist relies solely on personal reason to guide his creed, which was eminently agreeable to many thinkers of the time. Atheism was much discussed, but there were few proponents. Wilson and Reill note that, ""In fact, very few enlightened intellectuals, even when they were vocal critics of Christianity, were true atheists. Rather, they were critics of orthodox belief, wedded rather to skepticism, deism, vitalism, or perhaps pantheism."" Some followed Pierre Bayle and argued that atheists could indeed be moral men. Many others like Voltaire held that without belief in a God who punishes evil, the moral order of society was undermined. That is, since atheists gave themselves to no Supreme Authority and","A number of novel ideas about religion developed with the Enlightenment, including Deism and talk of atheism. Deism, according to Thomas Paine, is ""the belief, in a manner most unreasonable, that the universe is nothing other than a system of causes and effects, and that each of these causes and effects has a cause of its own, and must have its own effects, and will have its own existence in the end, and is thus self-existent, even if it did not exist for a moment in the beginning"". This philosophical belief was based on the idea that science and faith can't be reconciled.

New Atheists believe in something known as 'God' that is different from a supernatural being. They're quite happy to admit that science is not the end-all, be-all of knowledge.

For a man who is the author of a best-selling book, it was quite surprising when he began to turn his back on his faith.

"BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams. Nineteen of these teams played mainly in the Mountain West Conference from its inception in 1999 until the school left that conference in 2011. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the Western Athletic Conference. All teams are named the ""Cougars"", and Cosmo the Cougar has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the Cougar Fight Song. Because many of its players serve on full-time missions for two years (men when they're 18, women when 19), BYU athletes are often older on average than other schools' players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during","BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams.

TCU leads all schools with nine conference championships.

In football, the Cougars were winners of the 2001 BCS National Championship and have since claimed 27 conference championships and 36 league postseason awards. BYU has also won six Mountain West regular season championships, 16 Conference USA regular season championships and 12 MWC titles.

"The success of its football team made Notre Dame a household name. The success of Note Dame reflected rising status of Irish Americans and Catholics in the 1920s. Catholics rallied up around the team and listen to the games on the radio, especially when it knocked off the schools that symbolized the Protestant establishment in America — Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Army. Yet this role as high-profile flagship institution of Catholicism made it an easy target of anti-Catholicism. The most remarkable episode of violence was the clash between Notre Dame students and the Ku Klux Klan in 1924. Nativism and anti-Catholicism, especially when directed towards immigrants, were cornerstones of the KKK's rhetoric, and Notre Dame was seen as a symbol of the threat posed by the Catholic Church. The Klan decided to have a week-long Klavern in South Bend. Clashes with the student body started on March 17, when students,","The success of its football team made Notre Dame a household name.

In central and eastern Islamic lands, the view that the madrasa, as a charitable endowment, will remain under the control of the donor (and their descendent), resulted in a ""spurt"" of establishment of madaris in the 11th and 12th centuries. However, in Western Islamic lands, where the Maliki views prohibited donors from controlling their endowment, madaris were not as popular.
