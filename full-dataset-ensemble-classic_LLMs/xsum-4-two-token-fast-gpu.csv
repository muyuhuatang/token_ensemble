Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving.

"The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces.

The China Islamic Lawyer's Association, a private group, said the ban was ""cruel persecution against the Uighurs"".

An alternative proposal has been put forward by London Assembly Member Andrew Dismore, who recommends putting the 13 fire engines back into service but making savings","The removal of the engines, which have lain idle for two years, would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital. Savings from the proposal would be re-invested into the station.

A report said that the plan, which was unveiled by the National Infrastructure Commission in 2015, could have saved £350m to £400m a year.

According to the National Audit Office, the London Underground was suffering from funding shortfalls and had to impose a cut in ticket prices in 2014 by 14%.

The NCA said the costs of removing some of the oldest trains were ""relatively minor and could have been offset"" if they had not been in use for so long. However, the agency would not say how much the removal of these vehicles would save.

The report said that the removal of the fleet of 122 ""stub-style"" cars, which travel the London Underground network for less than 80km a day, would be ""much more disruptive and costly","The removal of the engines , which have lain idle for two years , would leave 142 active vehicles in the capital . Savings from the proposal would be invested in new car- sharing stations , including in the West End , which is set to see the arrival of some 50 new vehicles over the next six months and a `` digital bus `` , which would be available to about 100 customers across the city. The new scheme would be run by Go Mobile , an app company owned by Mr . Khan that has so far been hired to service the Go London app. Under the scheme , drivers could pick up a flat -top for £ 1 an hour . A city bus ticket would cost around 8 pence , while the return journey could be made for as little as 1 p ence .

"Mr Carney said long-term financing of green projects in emerging markets would promote financial stability. Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said.

But at the same time, Germany was looking to diversify sources of financing for its green energy projects as the crisis in Ukraine showed that it was still vital to support renewables, he said.

It also said it was considering plans to get cars off the city's road and replace them with buses instead by 2025, which would cost thousands of jobs and affect the economy of central London - not to mention the air pollution to be removed.

Now new research suggests that the government's commitment was no bluff.

It concluded that banning private vehicles from London's Tube network would save 1,935 lives, cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2,895 tonnes a year and result in the loss of 16,000 hours of lost work per year.

Experts have warned that pilots should not use drones for takeoff and landing, particularly when flying near populated areas. They also advise against flying in restricted airspace, where pilots should not be able to control flying.

In the New Zealand case, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority declined to comment on the individual case but said that due to the high risk from drones, ""aircraft pilots would not allow them on board"".

"NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) said blood group O negative was vital, as it could be used for patients with other blood groups in an emergency. It said O negative blood made up 12% of transfers, although only 7% of people in the UK had that blood type. Meanwhile, B negative blood is needed for ethnic groups. The NHSBT said ethnic minority groups, who were more likely to have B negative blood, were more prone to sickle cell anaemia, where misshapen blood cells could block blood vessels, causing an early death. It also said such groups were more at risk of developing thalassemia, a group of inherited blood disorders that hindered the blood's ability to carry oxygen.

Graham took the blow on the stomach and the guy came down with a terrible coughing fit. Graham, by this time in his stride, calmly returned to his bar stool, pulled the bar stool out from under him and sat down. The guy he had taken down made a grab for the chair from Graham and began to choke him. This went on for several seconds before the crowd rushed in to help him up. No major issues were reported after this but the guy from the other side of the bar was still a little peeved. He then tried to attack Gordon Ramsay while his friend in the back was trying to keep the crowd away.

Middle class benefits are often not thought of, and people's perceptions about the world are often clouded by a false sense of security,"" he added.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme.

It's important to understand that, just because a country is rich, for Oxfam and the government of Australia to see it as a poor country with little influence is wrong. To the contrary, Australia is a major player in the global economic growth and development system. This report, written by Oxfam's Australian and Japanese general secretaries, explains who the refugees actually are.

But governing body the FIA has decided a catch-all rule covering potentially dangerous driving is a better way of policing close-racing incidents. Each will be treated on its merits, said F1 director Charlie Whiting. Whiting added some of the controversial incidents last year related to this issue would potentially be treated differently were similar ones to occur in 2017. ""Before we said any move under braking would be investigated,"" Whiting said. ""Now, we have a simple, broad rule that says effectively if a driver moves erratically or goes unnecessarily slowly or behaves in a manner that could endanger another driver then he will be investigated."" Whiting said the idea for a ""more general way of approaching things"" had come about as a result","A regulation banning a practice known as ""moving under braking"" was adopted last year after drivers complained about Red Bull's Max Verstappen. But in a first, it was issued on Monday instead of last week after the Belgian newspaper Le Soir found evidence of the practice at the Barcelona track.

It happened when another driver and a marshal were talking about a crash involving Verstappen on Sunday and asked the marshal: ""Did Max use his brakes?""

Verstappen said yes, the marshal replied, but Verstappen's car was fitted with sensors which registered whether he had applied the brakes or not.

That is likely to have allowed Red Bull to use that information to assess the driver, either during or after a crash.

Le Soir found that a marshal had written that Verstappen's car had been fitted with the sensor as a ""cost saving measure"".

""At the conclusion of the investigation one",A regulation banning a practice known as `` moving under braking '' was adopted last year after drivers complained about Red Bull 's Max Verstappen .

In April, the Pentagon said it would stop training Somali soldiers after eight U.S. soldiers were killed in a single attack.

A series of mathematical formulas can help explain the creation of the universe, from the Big Bang to the laws of physics.

The maths behind them was discovered after an international team of scientists used a computer to test what happened to the energy of the universe at various points in time.

The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, looked at three dimensions of the space-time fabric.

For each axis, there is a 'big bang' for which we can calculate the temperature and density conditions as they changed.

A second dimension is the expansion of space-time over time.

These include an analysis of all the suicides in Britain between 1999 and 2002 in which an individual was taking an antidepressant and the year before, and comparing such individuals with people who did not take an antidepressant, which yielded an increased risk of suicide of nearly 20 percent for those who took the antidepressants.

However, for most people, the risk of becoming depressed is quite low, and the benefits of antidepressant treatment, like preventing suicidal thoughts, are high.

But he stressed that leaving would not mean an end to freedom of movement between the UK and the EU.

Mr Cameron's resignation as PM will probably come soon. His resignation should be announced at around 23:00 BST on Thursday.

Horrified neighbours tried to stop the fire engulfing their home, but collapsed one by one, as flames consumed their home on Thursday evening.

She was found at 11.30pm on Thursday, with her hands bound, by her elderly neighbours with a rope.

Miss Bell's daughter Sharon Gossill was said to have become fearful in recent months about her carer's safety, after an old care home where Miss Bell was living gave a warning about a woman who had told other people that she was being followed.

The convoy, organised by a number of campaign groups including the People's Assembly and Stop the War Coalition, made the decision to set off from outside the Houses of Parliament at 09:00 BST, despite a public order injunction being taken out by the authorities in Calais.

Thousands of drivers were left stranded and some drivers left cars at an impasse, as they waited for the ferry to arrive.

But the boat made a scheduled stop at Newquay at 21:30 BST, despite the ferry's crew telling those on board that their number was growing.

Ms","The boat sustained significant damage after the submarine snagged its fishing nets and pulled it backwards 18 miles off the County Down coast in April. Its skipper, John McFall said the boat, named the Daring, would have needed to be anchored more than 100 metres in front of the propeller to prevent the engine from grinding against the back of the craft. However, in order for the vessel to be safe the ship's rudder had to be raised to keep it on its course and prevent it from being turned off. Despite this, the boat came within 300 metres of the submarine.

According to reports, McFall feared for his life and decided to dive to the bottom to retrieve the rudder, only to realise the boat was too damaged to pull himself on board. The decision to stay on board had to stand to ensure the vessel was undamaged and that McFall was unhurt if the craft sank.

The evidence came out as a result of a long struggle by Sinn Féin and the SDLP on both an Irish Prison Service inquiry into abuses in Northern Ireland's jails, and an appeal by Massey's family against a jury verdict for murder.

""It was meant as an acknowledgement by Japan that, whatever it did at sea, it can't be the only way it will conduct scientific research,"" said Andrew Barratt from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, referring to the 2014 survey.

""It will, of course, not have a profound, lasting impact on the Australian relationship with Japan over the Antarctic.""

Barratt said the issue remained complex. ""What we've seen is a fairly incremental reaction to the science-based action and then an unwillingness to consider alternatives,"" he said. ""That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it must be said that this is a matter of urgency.""

The trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that the scheme could not go ahead while the council's planning policy against ""development for economic benefit"" on the site was in place.

The club was advised by the development firm to ask in a letter to the council last April: ""Why is this scheme not compatible [with the policy]?""

His parents and seven siblings, aged as young as two, deny charges of murder by a jury that will be told Hadley died from starvation, with the medical evidence pointing to the risk he would die within a few days - not weeks or months and with no signs of violence.

Wales had a good start and only conceded two tries against Canada and then looked impressive again at Twickenham in the autumn internationals.

The theft is the largest in a series of high-profile robberies in Cannes, which is famous for its annual film festival. The Carlton Hotel is where Alfred Hitchcock filmed To Catch A Thief - his 1955 film about a jewel thief operating in the French Riviera. During the latest theft, an exhibition of diamonds by the jeweller Leviev was being held in the lobby of the hotel. Local media said the robber made off with the jewels in a briefcase.

"Researchers were able to make drops grow six times faster than normal by copying the insects' shell geometry. Combined with other plant techniques, the team created drops that grew larger as temperatures increased. The authors say the development could significantly improve water harvesting and electricity generation. A little drop of water may seem insignificant but the physical processes involved in both the formation and movement of the liquid are essential to operation of thermal power plants, desalination and air conditioning systems.

The two-week trial in the Old Bailey started last month. The CPS is expected to make its announcement shortly after the jury returns on February 2.

A CPS spokesman added: ""We have no further comment to make.""

The trial is the second by the IPCC in Northern, and the first in England and Wales, and is the culmination of two investigations into deaths of unarmed, black people by police.

The first, launched in March 2011, found the case officers were justified in using lethal force on Mr Grainger, because he had been assaulting an officer with the intention of causing injury.

""Some think she was queen or pharaoh - whatever you want to call her. Others say one of her daughters did what he did,"" said Reeves, who has written books about Egyptian culture.

But some scientists said it is unlikely that Tutankhamun actually belonged to Nefertiti: A lack of genetic markers suggests that he was not related to her, and no conclusive archaeological evidence of any meeting on the Nile has been discovered as the king's remains have never been found.

On Monday, Mr Costa's Socialist government appointed a new president, Pedro Passos Coelho, a former Communist Party member. He was greeted with jubilation by protesters who blocked one of the main roads heading to the Presidential Palace.

The allegations against him stem from the government's 2012 decision not to renew state contracts related to Sao Paulo's World Cup stadium.

Earlier this year, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered Mr Toledo to give a testimony to a special prosecutor investigating the allegations against him.

The investigation was prompted after Odebrecht pleaded guilty to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to politicians, public officials and their relatives and business associates around the world.

The scandal deepened in April, when Brazilian prosecutors arrested several former construction executives in a similar case involving the construction of the Maracana stadium for the 2014 World Cup.

"Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say. Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: ""Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this. ""It is important that we understand how social media use relates to these. Evidence is increasingly supporting","Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say.

""People who use social media at night are more likely to be depressed, more likely to seek the help of their medical profession, more likely to binge drink — and more likely to use illegal drugs,"" the researchers wrote in their findings.

The study is the first to show increased negative emotions in night users compared with those who wake up.

The findings indicate that not all night users experience increased negative emotions.

""This is very important because night activity is only one of many factors that contribute to negative emotions. In this study, the use of social media is one factor among many, and it is only one factor among other contributors,"" co-author Dr. Steven C. Davis, chairman and co-director of the Center on Health Disparities and Health Disparities Research, said in the statement.

","Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media , and who use it at night , were more likely to feel depressed and anxious , they say . ( They used social media as a way to cope , either by using social media to deal with daily problems or through social media as a way of helping themselves or others . A study by the scientists led by Jennifer L . Goll ub , of Purdue University in the USA , used this same concept in a different study looking for link between use of social media and depression in college students . She says that the more one uses social media , the more likely he or sheis depressed , no matter what type of mental health problems they are going through . ) , a psychiatrist told the Daily Mirror , who is following the progress of the American study , that those with an eating disorder and /or social media addiction need professional help . ``",6.33

"STUC general secretary Grahame Smith will warn that it could take time to take advantage of new devolved powers. Responsibilities over income tax and welfare will be transferred to MSPs from April 2017. Mr Smith will make the plea as the STUC annual congress begins in Dundee on Monday. The general secretary of the Scottish Trades Unions Congress believes the campaign in the run-up to May's election ""doesn't yet reflect the possibilities provided by new powers"". Mr Smith said the vote would be ""the most important election to take place since the Scottish Parliament was re-established in 1999"".

His intervention will be made at a series of meetings from Wednesday until Friday as he attempts to convince the Scottish government to commit to greater tax spending.

An independent Scotland may be forced to keep using a range of current rates of income tax as well as new tax credits such as Universal Credit, which means the Scottish government could become liable for paying taxes at a higher rate than the rest of the UK, and the UK as a whole.

Mr Smith is also highlighting suggestions that a further new tax could be introduced in Scotland – a more substantial income tax rate. Scottish ministers are expected to face an unexpected challenge from Westminster when they meet later this month to discuss which of the two new tax options would be introduced first.","STUC general secretary Grahame Smith will warn that it could take time to take advantage of new devolved powers .

"The case concerns a Virginia public school district trying to prevent a female-born 17-year-old transgender student from using the boys' bathroom. The justices are expected to rule on the case before the end of June. The high court is one justice short after the death of Antonin Scalia, which could lead to a 4-4 decision. Schools districts nationwide remain conflicted on whether to require transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with the sex listed on their birth certificates. The justices accepted a petition from Gloucester County, Virginia, ruling that the school board was not required to comply with a lower court's order that transgender student Gavin Grimm should be allowed to use the boys' bathroom. Gavin, a student who was born female but identifies as male, came out as a transgender boy during his freshman year of high school. He sued the school board, arguing that they discriminated against him and its bathroom policy violated his civil rights. The US Court","The case concerns a Virginia public school district trying to prevent a female-born 17-year-old transgender student from using the boys' bathroom. The parents of the student are suing, alleging that the student is not sufficiently distressed during such bathroom usage to justify them. The school district says that if that were the case, the student would not be allowed to use the bathroom at all. The court will determine whether a student has the right to use a restroom consistent with their gender identity.

Texas and Oklahoma both have laws on the books that bar transgender people from using public restrooms that don't correspond to their birth gender. Transgender people are barred from using public restrooms using ""alternative facilities"" that do not match their gender at birth. But courts have been split on whether requiring transgender people to use bathrooms that do not exactly correspond to their anatomy is a violation of the constitutional rights of people to privacy and bodily privacy.","The case concerns a Virginia public school district trying to prevent a female-born 17-year-old transgender student from using the boys ' bathroom .

The teen , identified as John Doe , challenged the policy as unconstitutional .   He was born a male . Doe won in the Virginia Court of Appeals . The state Supreme Court upheld the ruling .

A sculpture at the Glastonbury Festival which included two soldiers landing on a deserted beach was commissioned to show how the ""silent majority"" should come together in the face of the challenges facing the world, the BBC reported.

The artist behind the artwork said she was inspired to create It's Time after visiting Glastonbury, which took place this weekend, where she ""saw people united"".

The college says it will file a motion to quash the subpoena.

It is possible that the Irish government is playing a big part in this too.

At the weekend, Minister Mary Mitchell O'Connor was quoted in a story saying she was not aware of a case where a politician had lied to a court.

Now we have an inquiry into this and as I know from visiting Irish diasporan organisations and politicians, the problem is deep rooted and deep rooted. Whether they know about it or not.

"Denis Donaldson was murdered in County Donegal in April 2006, months after being exposed as an agent who worked for the police and MI5 for 20 years. He was once a key figure in Sinn Féin's rise in Northern Ireland politics. The coroner adjourned the inquest until a separate criminal investigation is concluded. The inquest has previously been adjourned at least 19 times. Gardai Superintendent (Supt) Michael Finan told the coroner on Wednesday that a ""continuing, active, significant investigation"" was ongoing. He said an individual who had already appeared before the courts was due back in the Special Criminal Court in October and three arrests had been made in the last four months.

The murder of Donaldson comes amid renewed concern over the level of undercover police officers operating in Northern Ireland.

A total of 31 police officers were jailed for acts of misconduct, including four undercover officers whose covert work during the Good Friday talks led to widespread public concern during the unrest leading to the Good Friday Agreement.

The revelations come after the DUP's justice spokesman, Mark Durkan, asked the Attorney General to investigate allegations some gardaí may have been involved in any illegal activity.

Garda sources have said two alleged officers and a sergeant under the direction of Sgt Maurice McCabe in 2009 took part in an MI5 undercover operation.

The allegations have not been proven and, if substantiated, they could bring criminal convictions.","Denis Donaldson was murdered in County Donegal in April 2006 , months after being exposed as an agent who worked for the police and MI5 for 20 years .

"The prime minister raised the subject during talks with US President Barack Obama at the White House. Critics of existing rules say they make the extradition of UK nationals easier as the US authorities have to produce less evidence to support their case. But a senior judge reviewing it in 2011 found it was fair to British citizens. The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said Mr Cameron had raised the issue about how extradition rules are operating in practice during two hours of talks at the White House on Wednesday. The prime minister is in the middle on a three-day official visit to the United States. Concerns have been raised about the 2003 US-UK extradition treaty following controversial cases involving British citizens such as Christopher Tappin and Gary McKinnon.

The latest figures released show that 4,000 EU nationals are being detained in Britain on terrorism-related charges, a three-fold increase on the 3,900 last year.

They include British national Bilal Abdulla, 27, from Cardiff, who admitted membership of ISIL and other terror groups in court in the US.

Former Labour attorney general Dominic Grieve questioned the government's lack of commitment towards tackling the issue.

He told the Guardian: ""They don't have to make any sacrifices now to meet the new challenge of having thousands of terrorists, criminals and those convicted of violent offences on their doorstep.""

But the Home Office says that it is a ""vital"" part of their threat assessments, and is working with their international partners to address the issue.
