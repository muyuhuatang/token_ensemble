"The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region.

The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in China, a Muslim-majority nation that also bans the hijab and burqa.

The ""pigskin"" campaign comes as Muslims are being increasingly targeted by hardline Muslim separatists and Islamist extremists in Xinjiang, home to Muslim Uighurs. The campaign appears to have been led by Urumqi police.

The police crackdown on Islamic attire comes just days after Xinjiang officials announced the banning of headscarves in school-related activities.

The China Islamic Lawyer's Association, a private group, said the ban was ""cruel persecution against the Uighurs"".

The clothing and other items used in the campaign are seen by some as the latest effort by Beijing to portray the Chinese flag in a similar fashion to the red Chinese flag used to represent the Communist Party for nearly four decades . The Urumqi Municipal Cultural Commission said in a statement late Tuesday its regulations restricting “ Chinese symbols and images ” had been extended to “ face veils and cultural clothing that resembles the national flag. ” Other examples of Chinese symbols or images on garments including the national flag and other national symbols that have been included are the national Chinese characters on T-shirts and coats , “ the commission added .

Nanyang also noted that its Facebook group was flooded with messages from users saying their devices had stopped working since they received a notification from Jio that they had to upgrade their SIM cards.

"The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said the scheme will be rolled out across the country over the coming year. Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist at University College London specialising in antibiotic resistance,","The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics, NHS England said. It is hoped the service will help encourage more people to use antibiotics and to reduce demand for them.

Doctors who are using the service will have the option of setting a fixed tariff from which they can reduce.

""Patients would pay the money upfront to the consultant, rather than making appointments or paying through their GP on a per visit basis,"" said a Department of Health spokesman. ""Patients can decide where they want to have their appointments or where they want to pay.""

Currently, the amount that patients pay to consultants depends on their area of speciality. Consultants pay between £30 and £45 for each additional consultation in the GP network, for example. The department said that it would be the aim to roll out the scheme across the country.

Dr Mary Creagh, Labour's shadow public health minister, said that she welcomed","The walk-in service is aimed at reducing doctor appointments and to help reduce the over-use of antibiotics , NHS England said .

The volcano, located 49 km (30 miles) from the Sendai nuclear plant, is also close to Kagoshima, a city of 600,000. Sakurajima's last deadly eruption was in 1914, when 58 people died. The Japanese archipelago, which sits on the Pacific ""Ring of fire"", has more than 100 volcanoes. Sakurajima regularly spews ash and there are many small explosions there each year, with the latest eruption being in February. It is closely monitored by Japanese authorities and one of two volcanoes at Level 3 out of 5 levels in Japan's volcanic warning system, which means that people are warned not to to approach the volcano.

The study is published today in the journal Scientific Reports. It was led by Dr Simon Boxall from the University's School of Earth Sciences and the School of Physics, led by Dr Ewan Birney.

The team say the amount of seismic activity has increased by more than a factor of five since the volcano erupted on March 1st.

Murray told officers she had smoked marijuana for the past week and thought she was pregnant, even though she is carrying a toddler of her own six months older.

She explained she was worried about her child, whom she believed was not getting enough exercise or attention and was having difficulty with basic needs.

It had hoped to increase the number of turbines between Kent and Essex to 341. The area is the winter home of about 6,500 red-throated divers - at least one third of the UK's population. London Array said it had formally requested The Crown Estate to terminate the agreement for lease for the phase two area and had cancelled the grid capacity that was reserved at the National Grid substation in Graveney, Kent. The wind farm, 10 miles north of Ramsgate, Kent, was given the green light in 2006 on condition that phase two, to add an extra 166 turbines, would only go ahead if the red-throated divers were protected. The RSPB was concerned the population of the birds in the outer Thames estuary could be displaced by the extension. London","The group behind London Array wind farm said it would take three years to look at the possible effect of the extra turbines on red-throated divers.

A spokesman said the turbines were not visible from a distance, but he added they may well show up at low tide.

The UK has been given permission by the European Commission to build 10 wind farms by 2020.

The proposals include six on the west coast of Britain and four on the North Sea.

What is London Array? London Array is a project by French energy firm EDF. It aims to use turbines to store the electricity generated by wind farms, and convert that into electricity at a cheaper rate than the traditional power station

In March, EDF said that the project would cost £1.2bn (3.3 billion euros), which is expected to be paid for from the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive. These subsidies are designed to encourage wind power generation

Whiting said the idea for a ""more general way of approaching things"" had come about as a result","A regulation banning a practice known as ""moving under braking"" was adopted last year after drivers complained about Red Bull's Max Verstappen. But in a first, it was issued on Monday instead of last week after the Belgian newspaper Le Soir found evidence of the practice at the Barcelona track.

It happened when another driver and a marshal were talking about a crash involving Verstappen on Sunday and asked the marshal: ""Did Max use his brakes?""

Verstappen said yes, the marshal replied, but Verstappen's car was fitted with sensors which registered whether he had applied the brakes or not.

That is likely to have allowed Red Bull to use that information to assess the driver, either during or after a crash.

Le Soir found that a marshal had written that Verstappen's car had been fitted with the sensor as a ""cost saving measure"".

""At the conclusion of the investigation one","A regulation banning a practice known as `` moving under braking '' was adopted last year after drivers complained about Red Bull 's Max Verstappen . But governing body the FIA is reviewing a second rule that makes driving under the influence harder to detect . Last week , the Dutchman and his team crashed out when he tried to pass another car in the first corner of the Belgian Grand Prix . At the time of the crash , his team mate Daniel Ricciardo was in the lead . What is the law against moving under braking ? F1 has banned the `` moving under braking and accelerating , '' or `` MUBA '' trick since 2013 . This means that drivers must stay within the lines whenever possible and must move the brake pedal away from the accelerator when going into a corner . Moving under braking can make the braking point appear earlier . This is against the rules . At some circuits , this rule was relaxed to allow teams to use this rule to overtake . This year , this is again being looked at .",14.41

A series of mathematical formulas can help explain the creation of the universe, from the Big Bang to the laws of physics.

The maths behind them was discovered after an international team of scientists used a computer to test what happened to the energy of the universe at various points in time.

The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, looked at three dimensions of the space-time fabric.

For each axis, there is a 'big bang' for which we can calculate the temperature and density conditions as they changed.

A second dimension is the expansion of space-time over time.

The plane was eventually recovered, but many details are withheld for operational security purposes.

And some studies have identified higher risks for suicidal behavior and depression after antidepressant use. These include an analysis of all the suicides in Britain between 1999 and 2002 in which an individual was taking an antidepressant and the year before, and comparing such individuals with people who did not take an antidepressant, which yielded an increased risk of suicide of nearly 20 percent for those who took the antidepressants.

Its skipper, John McFall said the boat, named the Daring, would have needed to be anchored more than 100 metres in front of the propeller to prevent the engine from grinding against the back of the craft. However, in order for the vessel to be safe the ship's rudder had to be raised to keep it on its course and prevent it from being turned off. Despite this, the boat came within 300 metres of the submarine.

According to reports, McFall feared for his life and decided to dive to the bottom to retrieve the rudder, only to realise the boat was too damaged to pull himself on board. The decision to stay on board had to stand to ensure the vessel was undamaged and that McFall was unhurt if the craft sank.

Scotland are due to face Wales on Friday, but they will only do so as the home nation.

The Welsh have to change their format - meaning one minute in the second half instead of one minute in the first half - but it should make for more competitive and entertaining half-time entertainment.

It is a good opportunity for Wales coach Chris Coleman to get a grip on the game after England's poor start.

Wales had a good start and only conceded two tries against Canada and then looked impressive again at Twickenham in the autumn internationals.

The players should do well - and even if England do win against Wales, they will win comfortably by at least three tries - but it is vital that they have enough good, solid performances against Wales.

The Welsh government said it can consider its options once the detail of the proposed Childcare Bill is known. Currently, all three and four-year-olds are entitled to a minimum of 10 hours education delivered through the Foundation Phase.

The cars drove nearly 636,000 miles last year, compared with just over 424,000 in 2015. Other states in the US do not require such reporting. The California Department of Motor Vehicles published the annual reports on Wednesday.

""Disengagements are a natural part of the testing process that allow our engineers to expand the software' s capabilities and identify areas of improvement,"" Waymo said in its report.

In 2012, there were 624 such incidents involving electric minivans.

Last year, the number of incidents went up again to 743, according to Transport for London. Only one of the incidents, involving cars which were being prepared to test electric batteries, was caused by an alleged hit-and-run.

Ireland struck back when Scotland's goalkeeper Stuart MacDonald sent an attempted save over his own bar for a single point before Cha Dwyer equalised with a point from open play.

Wales could only manage two points in their opening win at Murrayfield.

The following year an independent inquiry found the IPCC was ""not sufficiently transparent"" about the process and how it reached its conclusions.

The inquest","Unarmed Anthony Grainger , 36 , was killed when he was shot in the chest during a Greater Manchester Police operation in Cheshire in 2012 .

""Some think she was queen or pharaoh - whatever you want to call her. Others say one of her daughters did what he did,"" said Reeves, who has written books about Egyptian culture.

But some scientists said it is unlikely that Tutankhamun actually belonged to Nefertiti: A lack of genetic markers suggests that he was not related to her, and no conclusive archaeological evidence of any meeting on the Nile has been discovered as the king's remains have never been found.

The investigation was prompted after Odebrecht pleaded guilty to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to politicians, public officials and their relatives and business associates around the world.

"Those with higher levels of emotional investment in social media, and who use it at night, were more likely to feel depressed and anxious, they say. Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: ""Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this.

Mr Smith said the vote would be ""the most important election to take place since the Scottish Parliament was re-established in 1999"". He wants party leaders to bring forward ""bold ambitious policies"" that will attempt to tackle some of the ""hitherto intractable problems in the Scottish economy and society"". Mr Smith will say: ""The next Scottish government really has to aspire to more than just managerial competence.

Responsibilities over income tax and benefits have proved too complex and divisive in Scotland, with each side in the debate blaming the other for the failings.

His intervention will be made at a series of meetings from Wednesday until Friday as he attempts to convince the Scottish government to commit to greater tax spending.

An independent Scotland may be forced to keep using a range of current rates of income tax as well as new tax credits such as Universal Credit, which means the Scottish government could become liable for paying taxes at a higher rate than the rest of the UK, and the UK as a whole.

Mr Smith is also highlighting suggestions that a further new tax could be introduced in Scotland – a more substantial income tax rate.

The justices accepted a petition from Gloucester County, Virginia, ruling that the school board was not required to comply with a lower court's order that transgender student Gavin Grimm should be allowed to use the boys' bathroom.

He said: ""If you and I do not vote together and you are not in a seat which is Conservative","The deputy prime minister told journalists that UKIP wanted to `` turn the clock back to the 1950s '' . UKIP leader Nigel Farage has predicted his party could hold power . UKIP won 23. 6 % of the vote in the election on 3 May . After May 's snap election , which has brought a hung parliament and a Conservative government led by Theresa May , it has emerged that two of the world 's biggest economies , the United States and the United Kingdom , have been engaging in a secret conversation. This meeting was not between ministers in Washington and London . Neither side told the other about it . And no one outside the United States and Britain knows about it . But what was discussed ? Was there a secret understanding as to what the USA should do , in return for Britain not leaving the European Union , that led to the June meeting ? And was the meeting more than a one-off conversation between two. The meeting took place - that 's what US and British diplomats have told us - during a state dinner in the UK 's honour .",12.0

Cattle are regularly tested are destroyed if they test positive for TB - 26,413 infected cattle were slaughtered in England in 2014. But questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the culls in controlling the spread of TB and whether badgers, which are shot at night, are being humanely killed. The figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, were revealed by The Badger Trust days after the government announced it would be rolling out the cull to Dorset. The Trust said the cost","Figures show that in 2012, when culling was postponed, the policy cost £2.5m. It then cost £9.8m this year to keep the number of cows kept on the reserve. The cost of operating the cull would be £7m an year – a small fraction of the £24 million generated by hunting.

A spokesperson for the gamekeepers group said: ""The decision to keep the ban in place was made after consultation with the farmers of the North Downs National Park, the National Trust, local farmers and government to discuss alternative methods of managing deer.

""Hunting in this area is extremely popular with many people and the gamekeepers group welcome any initiative to reduce the numbers of deer to maintain the landscape and landscape beauty.
